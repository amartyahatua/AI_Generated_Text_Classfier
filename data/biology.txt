Q1. Write a paragraph describing the North Atlantic right whale.
GT> The North Atlantic right whale is one of the world’s most endangered large whale species; the latest preliminary estimate suggests there are fewer than 350 remaining. Two other species of right whales exist: the North Pacific right whale, which is found in the North Pacific Ocean, and the Southern right whale, which is found in the southern hemisphere. Right whales are baleen whales, feeding on copepods (tiny crustaceans) by straining huge volumes of ocean water through their baleen plates, which act like a sieve.
By the early 1890s, commercial whalers had hunted North Atlantic right whales to the brink of extinction. (They got their name from being the "right" whales to hunt because they floated when they were killed.) Whaling is no longer a threat, but they have never recovered to pre-whaling numbers, and human interactions still present the greatest danger to this species. Entanglement in fishing gear and vessel strikes are the leading causes of North Atlantic right whale mortality. Increasing ocean noise levels from human activities are also a concern since the noise may interfere with right whale communication and increase their stress levels. 
NOAA Fisheries and our partners are dedicated to conserving and rebuilding the North Atlantic right whale population. We use a variety of innovative techniques to study, protect, and recover these endangered whales. We engage our partners, including the fishing and shipping industries, as we develop regulations and management plans that foster healthy fisheries and reduce the risk of entanglements, slow down vessel traffic, and reduce ocean noise.
ChatGPT> The North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) is a magnificent marine mammal known for its imposing size, reaching up to 50 feet in length and weighing over 70 tons. Its body is robust and streamlined, with a black, slate-grey or brownish-black coloration, and it is adorned with patches of rough, raised skin known as callosities, which are unique to each individual and can serve as identification marks. One of the most distinctive features of the North Atlantic right whale is its large, V-shaped blowhole located on top of its broad, massive head. Its mouth is equipped with baleen plates, which it uses to filter-feed on small crustaceans and plankton. Despite its imposing size, the North Atlantic right whale is known for its gentle nature, often exhibiting curiosity and approaching boats. However, it is critically endangered, with a population of only around 400 individuals remaining, facing threats such as entanglement in fishing gear, ship strikes, and habitat degradation. Efforts are being made to protect and conserve this iconic species and ensure its survival in the North Atlantic Ocean.

Q. How is the current population status of North Atlantic right whales?
GT> North Atlantic right whales have been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act since 1970. The latest preliminary estimate suggests there are fewer than 350 remaining, with fewer than 70 breeding females. The number of new calves born in recent years has been below average. They have experienced an ongoing Unusual Mortality Event since 2017, which includes sublethally injured or ill, seriously injured, and dead right whales. The whales impacted by the UME represent more than 20 percent of the population, which is a significant impact on an endangered species where deaths are outpacing births. Additionally, research demonstrates that only about 1/3 of right whale deaths are documented.
ChatGPT> As of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021, the current population status of North Atlantic right whales is critically endangered. The population has been declining in recent years, with only an estimated 400 individuals remaining. The species faces numerous threats, including entanglement in fishing gear, ship strikes, noise pollution, habitat degradation, and reduced availability of their primary food source due to climate change. The small population size and low birth rates further exacerbate the challenges faced by North Atlantic right whales in recovering their numbers. Conservation efforts, such as fishing gear modifications, ship speed restrictions in certain areas, and habitat protection measures, are being implemented to mitigate these threats and help ensure the survival of this iconic species. However, continued monitoring, research, and conservation actions are crucial to safeguard the future of North Atlantic right whales and prevent their further decline.

Q. Tell me about the appearances of North Atlantic right whales
GT> North Atlantic right whales have stocky black bodies with no dorsal fins, and their blow spouts are shaped like a “V.” Their tails are broad, deeply notched, and all black with a smooth trailing edge. Their bellies may be all black or have irregularly shaped white patches. Pectoral flippers are relatively short, broad, and paddle-shaped. Calves are about 14 feet at birth and adults can grow to lengths of 52 feet.

Their heads have knobby white patches of rough skin, called callosities, which appear white because of whale lice (cyamids) covering their otherwise black skin. Each right whale has a unique pattern of callosities that scientists use to identify individual whales, an invaluable tool in tracking population size and health. Aerial and ship-based surveys and the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium’s photo-identification database maintained by our partners at the New England Aquarium help track individuals over the years.

ChatGPT> The North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) has distinct physical characteristics that make it easily recognizable. These whales are massive in size, with adults measuring between 45 to 55 feet in length and weighing up to 70 tons. Their bodies are robust and streamlined, featuring a sleek, tapered shape that narrows towards the tail.

The head of a North Atlantic right whale is large, accounting for approximately one-quarter of its body length, and it lacks a prominent rostrum or beak. Instead, it has a rounded, bulbous shape with a wide, arched mouth that extends beyond the eyes. The mouth is lined with baleen plates, which are made of keratin and are used to filter-feed on tiny crustaceans and plankton from the water.

One of the most distinguishing features of the North Atlantic right whale is the presence of callosities on its head, which are patches of rough, raised skin that appear as white or yellowish patches on the otherwise dark-colored body. These callosities are infested with small crustaceans, giving them a rough texture and a distinct pattern that is unique to each individual whale, which can be used for identification purposes.

The North Atlantic right whale has a V-shaped blowhole located on the top of its head, through which it forcefully exhales air and water vapor when it surfaces to breathe. This blow can reach up to 15 feet in height and is one of the characteristic behaviors of these whales.

In terms of coloration, the North Atlantic right whale is typically black, slate-grey, or brownish-black on its back and sides, while its belly and underside tend to be lighter in color. However, due to the presence of patches of callosities and scars from encounters with ship strikes or fishing gear, the skin of North Atlantic right whales can appear mottled or scarred, which further adds to their unique appearance.

Overall, the North Atlantic right whale has a distinct and impressive appearance, with its massive size, rounded head, callosities, and unique coloration making it a remarkable and easily recognizable species.

Q. Why are North Atlantic right whales important?
GT> Right whales play important roles in ocean ecology. They help keep the marine ecosystem healthy and productive by redistributing nutrients from the ocean from the bottom to the surface through their fecal matter. After they die, their carcasses serve as food for other organisms.

While critically important to the ocean's health, the number of North Atlantic right whales is dwindling to dire levels. With less than 80 breeding females, the number of calves being born each year cannot keep pace with the number of human-caused deaths. The threats to NARW, as well as their precipitously low numbers, are directly related to human causes: fishing gear entanglement, ship strikes, and climate change.
ChatGPT> North Atlantic right whales are important for several reasons:

Q. What are scientists doing to protect right whales?
GT> Actions are being taken by the scientific community and concerned organizations to ensure the long-term survival of this critically endangered species.

1. Preventing entanglements:

According to the most recent U.S. stock assessment, entanglement in fishing gear is the leading cause of death; it also contributes to poor reproductive health for North Atlantic right whales in Canadian and U.S. waters. Most right whale mortalities are unobserved and the fishing gear is usually not found with whales determined to have died by entanglement. As a result, more than 90% of entanglements cannot be linked to a specific gear type, and only 12% of entanglements can be linked to a specific location.
 

Ocean scientists and engineers have developed and are refining On-Demand (also known as ropeless or buoyless) fishing technology providing a possible solution that could be both safe for the North Atlantic right whale and may offer opportunities for the Atlantic fishing industry. One device currently in use replaces the vertical line in the water column with a bottom-stowed coiled rope and buoy in a weighted cage. Fishers can send an acoustic signal , which sends the buoy to the surface and fishers can immediately haul the attached traps aboard. Efforts to reduce the cost of these systems are ongoing.
 

Disentanglement efforts have been successful at freeing hundreds of large whales that have become caught in fishing gear but can only reach a small proportion of the affected animals. Disentanglement operations along the East Coast of the U.S. are spearheaded by the Atlantic Large Whale Disentanglement Network, which comprises highly-trained emergency responders from 20 public and private organizations.
 

For the North Atlantic right whale to recover, NOAA determined that less than one whale per year can be seriously injured or killed. Data shows that North Atlantic right whale mortalities from fishing entanglement continue to occur at levels five times higher than the species can withstand. Furthermore, unless sub-lethal trauma from entanglements can be substantially reduced, and thereby calving success improved, recovery will not occur.
 

2, Preventing ship collisions:

Marine biologists and engineers have developed a device that listens for and identifies the sounds whales make underwater. Known as the digital acoustic monitoring (DMON) instrument, the device is equipped with underwater microphones called hydrophones and can be deployed on fixed buoys or autonomous underwater vehicles called gliders. Information collected by the DMON is transmitted every two hours via satellite back to a lab at WHOI. The data are then reviewed by an analyst and posted on the publicly accessible website, robots4whales.whoi.edu. More recently, these data have been used by Whale Safe, which monitors for ships and a variety of whale species-including the endangered blue whale-near Santa Barbara and San Francisco, California. On the east coast, acoustic buoys are located in highly trafficked migration routes, including in the Northeast, and off the coast of Savannah, Ga. and Norfolk, Va. 
 

Scientists are working to develop next-generation whale detection systems that use thermal infrared (IR) cameras to monitor for the presence of whales in shipping lanes. When mounted high enough above sea level-such as on offshore wind turbines-these systems can detect whales up to 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) away. Installed on ships, the systems can automatically alert shipping captains to the presence of whales up to a three-kilometer (1.8 miles) distance to allow most vessels to slow down or change course.
 

Vessel speed restrictions: Recently, NOAA Fisheries announced proposed changes to vessel speed regulations to further protect North Atlantic right whales from death and serious injuries resulting from collisions - part of a multifaceted approach to stabilize and recover this endangered population. The changes would expand the current mandatory seasonal speed restrictions of 10 knots or less in designated areas of the ocean and extend to most vessels measuring 35 feet or greater in length.
 

3. Reducing underwater noise pollution:

Right whales communicate with one another through vocal calls, which can be heard over distances of more than 20 miles when the ocean is quiet. The calls let whales stay in touch, share information about food, help mates find each other, and keep groups together while traveling. However, rising levels of ocean noise are interfering with their ability to communicate.
 

Innovative alternative techniques for probing geological structures beneath the ocean floor are being tested by scientists and industry. Traditionally, loud pulses are created by releasing air that is under extremely high pressure. A potential alternative is marine vibroseis, which uses the same energy but is spread over a longer duration. This eliminates the sharp "rise time" (rapid increase in loudness) and high peak pressure (maximum volume) of traditional techniques-the two characteristics of sound thought to be the most injurious to whales and other marine life.  Additionally, efforts are also being focused on how to reduce the sound level from ship traffic, which is steadily increasing, and offshore infrastructure, such as wind turbine construction.
ChatGPT> Scientists and conservation organizations are taking several measures to protect North Atlantic right whales, including:

Conservation and management measures: Scientists work with governments, fishing industries, and other stakeholders to develop and implement regulations and policies to reduce threats to North Atlantic right whales. This includes measures such as gear modifications to reduce entanglement risk, speed restrictions for ships in key habitats to mitigate ship strikes, and seasonal area closures to protect critical feeding and calving grounds.

This includes working with policymakers, advocating for funding and resources for conservation efforts, and participating in international forums and conventions related to marine conservation.

Overall, scientists play a crucial role in protecting North Atlantic right whales through research, monitoring, conservation planning, collaboration, public outreach, and policy engagement. Their efforts contribute to the conservation and management of this critically endangered species and help ensure its survival for future generations.

Q. What does recent research tell us about the future of right whales?	Collapse
GT> Recent research co-authored by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's senior scientist Michael Moore, shows that North Atlantic right whales are growing to a smaller adult size. The stunted growth of the whales coincides with an increasing rate of life-threatening entanglements, with less energy to devote toward growth. The scientists suggest that the ongoing stress of serious entanglements may reduce the reproductive rate of females, and possibly affect the survival of both calves and adults.

Most North Atlantic right whales that are severely injured in fishing gear entanglements die within three years, a study finds. Severely injured whales were up to eight times more likely to die than those with minor injuries, and only 44% of males and 33% of females with severe injuries survived longer than 36 months. Females that did survive had low birth rates and longer intervals between calving.

Additional research shows that smaller females produce fewer calves, and the declining body size of North Atlantic right whales may have critical consequences for the future of the species. Their smaller size means they may take longer to recover from the energetic cost of giving birth, especially in light of other stresses on the population. Decades of research on the species offer details about the stressors right whales face and, with this study, have gained further insights into how these stressors are affecting their reproduction.

Other hard-to-observe factors also influence reproduction and fecundity in North Atlantic right whales beyond female body length, including:

Prey availability
Climate impacts on the main feeding grounds
Maternal health
Sublethal stressors such as acoustic, vessel, and entanglement trauma, drain energy acquired by feeding, diverting it from calf productivity.
ChatGPT> Recent research on North Atlantic right whales has provided valuable insights into their future prospects. Some of the key findings from recent studies include:

Declining population trends: Studies have shown that the North Atlantic right whale population is declining, with estimates suggesting that there are only around 400 individuals remaining. This indicates a critical situation for the species, as the population is not recovering at a sustainable rate.

Threats from human activities: Research has highlighted the continued threats that North Atlantic right whales face from human activities such as entanglement in fishing gear, ship strikes, and habitat degradation. These threats continue to be the primary causes of mortality and serious injuries for right whales, posing significant challenges to their survival and recovery.

Reduced reproductive success: Studies have shown that the reproductive success of North Atlantic right whales has been declining, with fewer calves being born and surviving to maturity. This is likely linked to factors such as increased stress from entanglements and noise disturbance, reduced food availability, and other anthropogenic impacts, which can affect the health and reproductive fitness of the whales.

Shifts in distribution and habitat use: Recent research has shown changes in the distribution and habitat use of North Atlantic right whales, with shifts in their feeding and calving grounds. This may be influenced by changes in prey availability and distribution, shifts in oceanographic conditions, and other environmental changes, which can impact the availability and quality of suitable habitats for the whales.

Conservation successes: Despite the challenges, recent research has also highlighted some conservation successes for North Atlantic right whales. For example, efforts to reduce ship speeds in key areas and implement fishing gear modifications have resulted in reduced mortalities from ship strikes and entanglements. These conservation measures have shown promise in mitigating some of the threats to right whales and improving their survival prospects.

Need for continued conservation efforts: Overall, recent research underscores the urgent need for continued conservation efforts to protect and recover North Atlantic right whales. This includes ongoing monitoring, research, and management measures to reduce human impacts, protect critical habitats, and promote reproductive success. It also emphasizes the importance of continued collaboration among scientists, policymakers, conservation organizations, and other stakeholders to address the complex challenges faced by right whales and ensure their survival in the future.

In conclusion, recent research on North Atlantic right whales highlights the challenges and prospects for their future survival. While the population faces significant threats and declines, there are also successes in conservation efforts that provide hope for their recovery. Continued research, conservation action, and collaboration among stakeholders are essential to safeguard the future of this critically endangered species.

The species is quickly approaching extinction. Educating the public and those that rely on the oceans, and advancing solution-based technologies, is critical to our efforts to save North Atlantic right whales.

In addition to the science and technology expertise that WHOI brings to the challenge, WHOI scientists are members of the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium (NARWC),

which uses open source research to formulate science-based conservation measures to protect the NARW. Michael Moore and Mark Baumgartner, both former chairs of the NARWC, are co-founders of the Ropeless Consortium,

which promotes the sensible development, use, and education of On-Demand fishing gear, which offers a possible solution that could be both safe for the North Atlantic right whale and viable for the Atlantic fishing industry. Several prototypes are currently under development and some fishers are partnering with scientists to test different On-Demand fishing traps.  WHOI engineers have developed an On-Demand technology that uses an acoustic signal to release a line from a trap, and Mark Baumgartner and WHOI engineer Jim Partan developed a gear location marking system specifically for On-Demand fishing. In collaboration with federal, non-governmental, and fishing industry consultants, WHOI researchers continue to work on improving gear. With support from the SeaWorld Conservation Fund, and other collaborators, they are helping to test offshore On-Demand systems.
ChatGPT> Yes, there is still hope for saving the North Atlantic right whales, but it will require concerted efforts from governments, conservation organizations, stakeholders, and communities to address the threats they face and implement effective conservation measures. Some of the key steps that can help in saving North Atlantic right whales include:

Reducing entanglement risk: Implementing and enforcing regulations to reduce the risk of entanglement in fishing gear, such as through gear modifications, seasonal closures, and improved fishing practices. This can help minimize the injuries and mortalities caused by fishing gear entanglements, which is one of the major threats to right whales.

Mitigating ship strikes: Implementing speed restrictions for vessels in key habitats, changing shipping routes, and using technologies such as acoustic devices to warn whales of approaching ships can help reduce the risk of ship strikes, which is another significant threat to right whales.

Protecting critical habitats: Identifying and protecting critical feeding, calving, and migratory habitats of North Atlantic right whales, including important areas for prey availability and other essential ecological features. This can involve establishing marine protected areas, habitat restoration, and conservation planning to ensure the availability of suitable habitats for the whales.

Monitoring and research: Continued monitoring and research efforts to better understand the population dynamics, behavior, and ecology of North Atlantic right whales, and inform conservation strategies and management decisions. This includes using advanced technologies such as satellite tagging, acoustic monitoring, and aerial surveys to gather data on their movements, health, and reproductive success.

Public outreach and education: Raising awareness among the public, stakeholders, and communities about the importance of North Atlantic right whales and the need for their conservation. This can involve educational programs, public events, media campaigns, and community engagement efforts to foster support for conservation measures.

WHOI believes that it is possible to protect both critically endangered North Atlantic Right Whales and the economic interests of lobster fishers, shipping companies, and others who work in the ocean. Our focus is on developing tools and technologies needed to achieve both important goals and provide the science needed to inform fair and effective public policies.

We must focus on helping develop and advance solutions, which do exist. On-Demand fishing is one way for both right whales and trap and fixed-net fishing industries to survive.

There is a clear need for governments and industry to implement measures that will help bring the North Atlantic right whale back from the brink of extinction.  The challenge of doing so while minimizing economic impacts are significant and WHOI remains committed to working with states, industry, NOAA and other policy and regulatory entities to ensure NARW conservation measures are effective and successful.
ChatGPT> As an AI language model, I do not have real-time information or access to the latest updates. WHOI (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution) is a leading research organization that conducts scientific research on marine ecosystems, including North Atlantic right whales. However, I do not have information on their current or specific position on North Atlantic right whale conservation measures. It's best to refer to WHOI's official website, publications, or contact them directly for the most up-to-date and accurate information on their position or involvement in North Atlantic right whale conservation efforts. Conservation positions and measures may also evolve over time as new research and information become available, and organizations like WHOI may adapt their approaches accordingly.

Q. Does aquaculture/kelp farming impact marine animals?
GT> The need for right whale conservation efforts is clear given the status of the population.  Our collective goal is to advance the scientific conversation and create the conditions for balanced solutions that account for both perspectives. WHOI is actively working to encourage dialogue between researchers conducting experiments with kelp farming and those who are working to support right whale conservation, and we believe it is possible to advance both aims in a mutually satisfactory manner.

R&D runs across a broad spectrum of disciplines, some of which can generate scientific and policy debate. There are community-wide efforts to develop strategies to avoid and minimize impacts to all marine protected species. Solutions can include testing varying equipment and different locations to mitigate potential entanglement. Regulatory agencies will decide how these initiatives will co-exist.
ChatGPT> Aquaculture, including kelp farming, can have both positive and negative impacts on marine animals, depending on the specific practices and management measures in place. Here are some considerations:

Positive impacts:

Habitat creation: Some forms of aquaculture, such as mussel or oyster farming, can create artificial habitat structures that can serve as a refuge for marine animals, including fish, crustaceans, and other invertebrates.

Reduced pressure on wild fish stocks: Sustainable aquaculture practices can help reduce the pressure on wild fish stocks, as they provide an alternative source of seafood and reduce the need for overfishing in the wild.

Ecological services: Kelp farming, specifically, can have positive impacts on marine ecosystems as kelp acts as a natural filter, absorbing excess nutrients from the water and improving water quality. Kelp can also provide nursery grounds for various marine species and contribute to the overall biodiversity of marine habitats.

Negative impacts:

Escapes and interactions with wild animals: There is a risk of escape of farmed species from aquaculture facilities, which can potentially impact wild populations through competition, interbreeding, or disease transmission. For example, escaped farmed salmon can interbreed with wild salmon, potentially diluting genetic diversity and reducing the fitness of wild populations.

Environmental impacts: Aquaculture operations can generate waste, excess nutrients, and other environmental impacts such as sedimentation, which can potentially affect water quality, habitats, and marine life in the surrounding areas.

Chemical use: The use of chemicals, including antibiotics, pesticides, and antifouling agents, in aquaculture operations can potentially have negative impacts on marine animals, including non-target species, by contaminating the water and affecting their health.

Feed production: The production of feed for farmed species, which is often based on fishmeal and fish oil derived from wild-caught fish, can contribute to overfishing of wild fish stocks, affecting marine food webs and ecosystems.

Habitat modification: Some forms of aquaculture, such as finfish farming in open net pens, can result in physical habitat modification, such as seabed disruption, which can impact benthic organisms and other marine life in the area.

It's important to note that the environmental impacts of aquaculture, including kelp farming, can vary depending on the specific practices, management measures, and location of the aquaculture operations. Implementing sustainable aquaculture practices, such as proper siting, monitoring, and management of aquaculture operations, can help minimize the negative impacts and promote the sustainability of marine ecosystems. Proper regulation, certification schemes, and best management practices can play an important role in ensuring that aquaculture operations are carried out in an environmentally responsible manner and minimize potential impacts on marine animals.

Q. What Will It Cost to Create a Safer Ocean for Endangered Right Whales?
GT> With fewer than 350 North Atlantic right whales left on the planet, the species is one step away from extinction . Humans pose the biggest threat to their survival due to entanglements with fishing gear and collisions with ships and boats. Ropeless fishing gear (also called “on-demand,” “pop-up,” and “buoyless” systems) offers a promising solution to entanglements by eliminating the deadly maze of vertical lines that connect buoys on the surface with traps on the seafloor.

The idea of fishing without vertical lines has been around for a while. The reality requires investments in new equipment and an adjustment in longstanding, cultural fishing practices – which can be a tough sell for the fishing community. 

But affordability has been the real showstopper. Switching one boat to ropeless fishing gear can be expensive enough, let alone an entire fleet. We wanted to understand just how expensive – and what it would take for those costs to come down.

We analyzed two illustrative sectors of the commercial lobster fishery and detail the findings in a new report. It will come as no surprise that the costs are significant – topping $24 million to convert 70 offshore permit holders to ropeless gear in one sector and $125 million to outfit 409 nearshore boats in the other. However, we project that the costs of this innovative new gear could drop by as much as 50% as its adoption scales up – just like with any new technology.

NOAA Fisheries recently described  ropeless gear systems as “the best solution to separate rope and right whales in areas of highest risk.” It’s time for the agency and Congress to put weight behind these words. Legislation passed late last year dedicates monies to fund innovative gear technologies and directs NOAA to take action to make this transition a reality. Private sector investment also will be needed.

We hope this report provides a starting point for determining and securing the funding needed now and into the future to create a healthy ocean where both whales and fishermen can thrive.

Our Approach to Modeling the Costs to Transition to Ropeless Fishing Gear
Several factors went into the financial model we created for this report: the cost of outfitting a particular vessel, the current pricing of ropeless gear systems, and regulatory requirements that impact how and where a vessel can fish, among others. We then determined where readily available data helps account for these factors.

We found two sectors provided the most complete data for our modeling: Massachusetts state-permitted fishermen operating with boats 30 feet or longer in nearshore Lobster Management Area 1 or LMA1 (which is marked in its entirely in teal on this map ) and federally permitted lobstermen fishing far offshore in Lobster Management Area 3 or LMA3 (shown in blue on this map ).   

We then chose a gear manufacturer to base costs on – one that represents a midpoint in pricing across current manufacturers. Fishermen using gear from other manufacturers could see higher or lower costs.

To estimate the cost of outfitting a particular vessel, we also included the costs of the necessary equipment: a deck box, a hull-mounted transducer, some number of ropeless release systems (and associated cages and buoys) attached on one or both ends of the trawls, and the software necessary to mark and release gear.

Ropeless Gear Costs are High Right Now But Can Drop with Increases in Production Volume
We found that converting all vessels 30 feet in length or more in the nearshore Massachusetts Lobster Management Area 1 fishery would cost approximately $128 million. Converting all 70 active permit holders in Lobster Management Area 3 would amount to roughly $24 million.  

Exact costs depend on several factors. For example, fully equipping a nearshore vessel that sets 500 traps, with 11 traps on each trawl, and uses one ropeless release per trawl, would cost an estimated $227,000 today. On the other hand, fully equipping an offshore vessel that sets 1,900 traps, with 45 traps on each trawl, and uses two ropeless releases per trawl, would cost roughly $344,000. 

These costs are significant. However, they should not be considered a reason to dismiss ropeless gear as a viable solution. Instead, they should be viewed as an incentive for further investment. Here’s why.

To date, only a limited number of ropeless gear systems have been built and installed. And the fishermen using these systems continue to provide input on how to modify them. So, their manufacturing volume has yet to reach the tipping point to achieve economies of scale. But if just the two sectors of the industry we analyzed fully converted, the volume of gear produced would dramatically increase.  

That, in turn, could reduce the cost per vessel by about 50% for the two sectors we modeled, based on a conservative learning rate reflecting a high degree of manufacturing automation and the gear volumes noted above. Fleetwide conversion costs would then drop to $62 million for Management Area 1 and $13 million for Management Area 3. And if portions of the Maine fishery were to convert, it would drive even more volume and reduce costs further. 

Our report also models the theoretical financial benefit of reduced gear loss, as release systems sending an acoustic signal describing their location could be easier to find if moved in a storm or by another vessel.  

Our results provide a snapshot of costs based on the data available in late 2022. As new technologies evolve, we may see different costs and volume assumptions. 

Congress Recently Passed a Spending Bill that Could Fund the Transition
Late last year, Congress passed a spending bill that sets aside $20 million in fiscal year 2023 and potentially another $500 million over the next ten years to fund technologies that will reduce the toll of human activities on right whales. Based on our current model, these authorized funds could, if properly appropriated, make the transition to ropeless gear a reality.

It is also imperative that ropeless gear is safe, reliable, and efficient for fishermen. Ongoing gear tests supported by NOAA here in Massachusetts are helping to provide valuable feedback to manufacturers to ensure fishermen feel confident about using the gear in all kinds of conditions.

Ropeless Gear Can Allow Fishing to Continue and Give Right Whales a Fighting Chance
Ropeless fishing gear, properly subsidized, would allow lobster fishermen to continue fishing while giving North Atlantic right whales a better chance of survival as a species. Without this transition, fishermen face widespread closures of areas where right whales congregate – and right whales face a dangerous ocean that puts their lives and entire future at risk.
ChatGPT> The cost of creating a safer ocean for endangered North Atlantic right whales can vary greatly depending on the specific measures and strategies implemented. Some of the potential costs associated with conservation efforts to protect North Atlantic right whales may include:

Research and monitoring: Conducting research to better understand the ecology, behavior, and distribution of North Atlantic right whales requires funding for research vessels, equipment, personnel, data analysis, and ongoing monitoring efforts. This can involve costs for fieldwork, data collection, laboratory analysis, and data management.

Conservation measures: Implementing conservation measures to reduce entanglement risks, such as modifying fishing gear or implementing gear marking and tracking technologies, can require financial investments. This can also include costs associated with implementing and enforcing regulations, policy development, and compliance monitoring.

Outreach and education: Raising public awareness, conducting education and outreach campaigns, and engaging stakeholders in conservation efforts can require funding for communication materials, public events, educational programs, and community engagement initiatives.

Management and enforcement: Enforcing regulations, implementing management measures, and patrolling protected areas can require funding for personnel, equipment, vessels, and infrastructure. This can involve costs associated with surveillance, patrols, inspections, and enforcement actions.

Collaborative efforts: Collaborating with other stakeholders, such as fishing industry, shipping industry, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations, to develop and implement conservation measures may involve costs for coordination, stakeholder engagement, and collaborative initiatives.

Technology and innovation: Developing and deploying innovative technologies and tools, such as acoustic monitoring, remote sensing, or underwater robotics, to better understand and mitigate threats to right whales may require financial investments in research and development, equipment, and operational costs.

It's important to note that the cost of creating a safer ocean for endangered North Atlantic right whales is a complex issue that depends on many factors, including the scope and scale of conservation measures, the level of stakeholder involvement, the geographic area covered, and the duration of the conservation efforts. Funding for conservation initiatives may come from various sources, including government agencies, non-governmental organizations, private foundations, industry partnerships, and public donations.

The total cost of creating a safer ocean for endangered North Atlantic right whales is difficult to estimate accurately and can vary over time. However, it's widely recognized that conservation efforts are essential to protect and recover endangered species like North Atlantic right whales, and the costs associated with these efforts are considered an investment in the long-term health and sustainability of marine ecosystems.

Q. How can we developed Robotic buoys to keep Atlantic right whales safe? 
GT> A Cape Cod science center and one of the world’s largest shipping businesses are collaborating on a project to use robotic buoys to protect a vanishing whale from lethal collisions with ships.

A lab at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution developed the technology, which uses buoys and underwater gliders to record whale sounds in near real time. The robotic recorders give scientists, mariners and the public an idea of the location of rare North Atlantic right whales, said Mark Baumgartner, a marine ecologist with Woods Hole whose lab also operates the buoys.

The whales number less than 340 in the world and ship strikes are one of the biggest threats to their existence, as they travel through some of the busiest stretches of ocean on the planet. Now, French shipping giant CMA CGM is working with Woods Hole to deploy two of the robotic buoys off of Norfolk, Virginia, and Savannah, Georgia.

CMA CGM is funding the deployment of the buoys, which will add to the data collected by six others off the East Coast, Baumgartner said. The two new buoys could be deployed for testing soon, he said.

“We have to change our industrial practices when whales are around. That’s what this tech enables,” Baumgartner said. “Having the industry tell us what works and what doesn’t is the best way to have solutions that will actually be implemented.”
The whales were once abundant off the East Coast, but their populations were decimated generations ago by commercial whaling. These days, they’re vulnerable to ship collisions and entanglement in fishing gear. And they’ve dwindled in population in recent years because of high mortality and poor reproduction.

The whales are aided by a complex network of protected areas and shipping restrictions. However, scientists have sounded alarms recently that the whales have been straying outside of protected areas in search of food as waters warm. That has made them more vulnerable.

Representatives for CMA CGM, which has a U.S. headquarters in Norfolk, said the company chose to locate buoys off the Virginia city and Savannah because those are among the busiest shipping ports in the United States. Ed Aldridge, president of CMA CGM America, said it’s an effort to “responsibly share the ocean with marine mammals and protect endangered species.”

The company is paying for the construction, maintenance and operation of the buoys for three years, said Heather Wood, director of sustainability for CMA CGM America. The company declined to disclose the cost of the project. It hopes to build a consortium of shippers that use this kind of technology to protect whales, Wood said.

“It’s an investment we’re making in the future of the seas and the future of the right whale,” she said.

Acoustic recorders have tracked whale sounds for decades, but the buoys that provide sound in near real time are a relatively recent invention, Baumgartner said. The robotic buoys make data available every couple of hours as opposed to months later, he said.

The results go on a public website and are also used by federal authorities to help make decisions about when to announce “right whale slow zones,” which call on vessel operators to slow down to 10 knots (11.5 mph) or less.

The data “allow us to send information to mariners quickly so those that are able can take action (by slowing down or avoiding the areas) to reduce the risk of vessel strike, which is one of the largest threats to this endangered population,” scientists Diane Borggaard and Genevieve Davis of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in a joint statement.

Conservation groups and academics also use the data collected by the robotic buoys. They’re also used on the West Coast to help protect blue, fin and humpback whales, said Callie Steffen, a project scientist with Whale Safe in Santa Barbara, California.

“We hope shipping companies will integrate this,” Steffen said. “It’s a Smokey Bear fire warning, but for whale presence.”
ChatGPT> Developing robotic buoys could be a promising approach to help keep North Atlantic right whales safe. Here are some potential ways that robotic buoys could contribute to conservation efforts:

Early warning systems: Robotic buoys equipped with sensors and monitoring devices could help detect the presence of North Atlantic right whales in real-time. By collecting data on whale movements, vocalizations, and other relevant parameters, these buoys could provide early warning systems to alert nearby vessels of the presence of whales and enable them to take appropriate actions to avoid collisions.

Acoustic monitoring: Robotic buoys with hydrophones or underwater listening devices could monitor underwater noise, including vessel traffic, to identify potential areas of high noise pollution that may pose a risk to North Atlantic right whales. This data could be used to inform decision-making and conservation strategies, such as identifying areas to implement vessel speed restrictions or other measures to reduce noise impacts on whales.

Gear marking and tracking: Robotic buoys could be used to deploy and monitor gear marking and tracking technologies, such as radio or satellite tags, on fishing gear. This could help track the movement and location of fishing gear in real-time, reducing the risk of entanglement for North Atlantic right whales and other marine animals.

Autonomous monitoring and reporting: Robotic buoys could operate autonomously, collecting data on environmental conditions, whale sightings, and other relevant parameters, and transmitting this information in real-time to researchers, conservation organizations, or other stakeholders. This could help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of data collection, monitoring, and reporting efforts, and enable timely responses to potential threats.

Remote sensing: Robotic buoys could be equipped with remote sensing technologies, such as cameras or drones, to collect visual data on whale behavior, health, and habitat use. This could provide valuable information for understanding the ecological requirements of North Atlantic right whales and informing conservation strategies.

Education and outreach: Robotic buoys could also be used as educational tools to raise awareness and engage stakeholders in conservation efforts. For example, buoys with multimedia capabilities could share educational content, such as videos, images, or other interactive materials, to inform the public about the plight of North Atlantic right whales and the need for conservation action.

However, it's important to note that developing and deploying robotic buoys for right whale conservation would require careful consideration of technical, operational, logistical, and ethical aspects. This would include ensuring the safety and welfare of the whales, minimizing any potential negative impacts, complying with relevant regulations and guidelines, and engaging in collaborative efforts with stakeholders, including researchers, conservation organizations, government agencies, and industry partners. Proper testing, validation, and evaluation of robotic buoy technologies would also be necessary to ensure their effectiveness and reliability in real-world conservation applications.

Q. What are the effects of trauma from the shipping and fishing industries on North Atlantic right whale survival and welfare?
GT> Iwas 23 years old the first time I saw a whale entangled in a large codfish trap. I was researching humpback whales off the coast of Newfoundland in 1979, and the animal’s pain and suffering, along with the apparent extreme agitation of another whale close to it, struck me to my very core.

44 years later, it still hits a nerve: Whales are continuing to suffer and die after becoming struck by vessels and entangled in fishing gear—and doing so at a rate great enough to put the North Atlantic right whale in critical danger of going extinct.

A 2022 report from the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium finds there are just 340 North Atlantic right whales left and the population continues to spiral downward. These whales live most of their lives in a highly “urbanized” ocean, where fishermen set up to 1 million vertical lines along their migratory routes and foraging areas. Entanglement in these lines is their leading cause of injury and death.

It’s an unfortunate mismatch of risk. The chance of one trap out of a million entangling a whale is small, but the likelihood of a whale becoming entangled while swimming through a million lines is very substantial. Likewise, the risk of any one whale being struck by a vessel is vanishingly small, yet vessel strikes are the second most common cause of injury and death to right whales. If we do not find a way to manage for these risks, we will be responsible for letting an entire species of whale go extinct.

Data shows that over 80% of these whales have been entangled in fishing gear. Many have been entangled multiple times. Of whales that die from entanglement only a minority are documented, as they often sink to the bottom of the ocean undetected. The average duration of a lethal right whale entanglement is about six months.

If a mammal the size of a whale were entangled and slowly dying in the streets of Boston for six months, it would be utterly unacceptable to society. This is exactly what’s happening at sea. The only difference is that we don’t see them as they struggle and pass away. Out of sight cannot mean out of mind.

Whale scientists have been warning for years that additional measures are needed to reduce these entanglements. To win the race to save the North Atlantic right whale, we must take the long view and show restraint and respect for our ocean resources. The broader role of large whales as ecosystem engineers and carbon sinks is an active research area. Feeding in dark, deeper waters, and then releasing nutrients in shallow, well-lit surface waters to fertilize the marine food web, and hence increase fishery productivity, is good for both whale and human food supplies.

To make that happen, we need to think about dual sustainability. The fishing community, elected officials, resource managers, and consumers need to respect the science that highlights why urgent action is needed to stop whale entanglements and strikes by vessels.

We must also respect the fishing industry’s need to make a living and help scale solutions to entanglement, such as on-demand gear, which allows fishers to regain access to areas closed to traps with vertical buoy lines. Traditional marking and recovery of traps for seafood uses a vertical line from the sea bottom to a surface marker, presenting a major whale entanglement risk. Prime trap-fishing areas in important whale habitats can be closed seasonally for whale conservation in US and Canadian waters. On-demand fishing eliminates persistent vertical lines by using sound to trigger trap recovery, and a digital position marker in place of the surface marker. In 2022, using on-demand fishing, over a million pounds of snow crab were harvested and sold, in areas of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada, that were closed to vertical lines for whale conservation. This resulted from cooperative efforts by fishers, gear manufacturers, government regulators and engineers, scientists, and non-profits to develop, acquire and deploy these solutions. Vessel strikes can be controlled by avoidance of high-risk areas, or mandatory, enforced speed limits.

Right whales are ready for change. They can calve every three years, but food availability and entanglement stress make that very rare today. Some need more than 10 years between births, while others never do calve. Their projected body length as adults has shrunken by a meter in the past 40 years.

It’s up to all of us to decide if we care about sustaining a diverse and healthy planet by demanding ethical supply chains. But above all, we must recognize that the pain and drawn-out suffering that rope entanglement causes to these animals is unacceptable and quickly work together to put an end to it.

The inevitable endpoint of the loss of biodiversity, whether it be whales, birds, fish, plants, or much smaller organisms, is that the human species will be left in a destitute environment, incapable of supporting ourselves. We must turn around and start to look at the longer view, and work together to find solutions that allow both the whale and the lobsterman to thrive.
ChatGPT> The shipping and fishing industries can have significant effects on the survival and welfare of North Atlantic right whales, including trauma-related impacts. Here are some potential effects:

Collisions: Ship strikes are a major threat to North Atlantic right whales, as they can result in severe injuries or mortality. Large vessels, such as cargo ships, container ships, and tankers, can collide with whales while they are at or near the water surface, causing blunt force trauma, broken bones, internal injuries, and other serious injuries that can be fatal or reduce the chances of survival.

Entanglement: Fishing gear, such as ropes, nets, and traps, can entangle North Atlantic right whales, leading to injuries, trauma, and even death. Whales entangled in fishing gear may experience chronic stress, reduced feeding ability, impaired movement, and other negative impacts that can affect their survival and welfare.

Noise pollution: Shipping and fishing activities can also generate underwater noise, which can disrupt North Atlantic right whales' communication, foraging, and other behaviors. Prolonged exposure to high levels of noise can cause stress, disorientation, and trauma in whales, potentially leading to negative effects on their overall health and well-being.

Habitat disruption: Shipping and fishing activities can result in habitat disruption, such as changes in water quality, disturbance to prey availability, and alteration of migratory patterns. These disruptions can have indirect effects on North Atlantic right whales by affecting their food sources, migratory routes, and other aspects of their natural environment, potentially leading to long-term consequences for their survival and welfare.

Reduced reproductive success: Trauma from shipping and fishing activities, such as collisions and entanglements, can also impact the reproductive success of North Atlantic right whales. Injuries sustained from these activities may reduce their ability to reproduce, including the ability to successfully mate, carry and nurse calves, and raise healthy offspring, which can have significant implications for the long-term survival of the population.

Efforts to mitigate these impacts on North Atlantic right whales include implementing vessel speed restrictions in areas where they are known to occur, modifying fishing gear to reduce the risk of entanglements, implementing noise reduction measures, and promoting responsible shipping practices. These efforts often involve collaboration between researchers, conservation organizations, government agencies, and industry stakeholders to develop and implement effective mitigation measures to minimize the trauma and other negative impacts on North Atlantic right whales and promote their conservation and welfare.

Q. How did Seafood Watch determine which fisheries are responsible for whale entanglements?
GT> The reality is that whales, including the North Atlantic right whale, are being entangled in fishing gear using vertical lines such as traps/pots and gillnets in both US and Canadian waters. In fact, since the September 6 release of our Seafood Watch red ratings, a North Atlantic right whale called Snow Cone was observed entangled in fishing gear and is not expected to survive.  

This letter from leading whale experts helps to correct the misinformation circulating on whale entanglements and risk. The North Atlantic right whale lives along the east coast of the U.S. and Canada with year-round presence throughout the range.  

According to the most recent stock assessment, entanglement in fishing gear that uses vertical lines is the leading cause of serious injury and death to the North Atlantic right whale. The U.S. government has made it clear that “the fact that right whales have not been identified in any recent interactions with lobstermen does not mean mortalities don’t occur.” 

In the U.S., NOAA apportions responsibility to all fisheries that pose risk to the North Atlantic right whale – an approach supported by a recent court ruling. Seafood Watch used NOAA’s information in these assessments as it represents the best available science.

Update: On January 8, 2023, an aerial survey team sighted a heavily entangled right whale approximately 20 miles east of Rodanthe, North Carolina. There were several wraps of line around the mouth and tail, with additional line trailing behind the whale. After reviewing documentation of this new entanglement case, NOAA Fisheries biologists made a preliminary determination that it meets the criteria of a “serious injury.” This means the whale is likely to die from this injury. Scientists with the New England Aquarium identified the whale as right whale #4904, a 4-year-old juvenile female that was last spotted in May 2022, in the Massachusetts Bay. She had no entanglements at that time.

Since this incident, several additional whale entanglements have occurred. Access the latest North Atlantic right whale updates from NOAA here.
ChatGPT> Seafood Watch, a program run by the Monterey Bay Aquarium, assesses the sustainability of fisheries and aquaculture operations based on a set of criteria, which includes the impacts of fishing practices on marine wildlife, including whale entanglements. The assessment process involves gathering and analyzing data from a variety of sources, including scientific studies, government reports, fishery management plans, and other credible information.

To determine which fisheries are responsible for whale entanglements, Seafood Watch relies on scientific evidence and data that document cases of entanglements and their association with specific fisheries. This may include information on the number and frequency of entanglement incidents, the types of gear used in the fisheries, the geographic location and timing of entanglements, and the species of whales involved. The assessment process takes into account the available evidence and scientific consensus on the relationship between fishing practices and whale entanglements, as well as the effectiveness of management measures and mitigation efforts in reducing entanglement risks.

Seafood Watch also collaborates with experts in the field of marine conservation, including marine biologists, fishery managers, and other stakeholders, to ensure a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the impacts of fishing practices on whale entanglements. The assessment results are used to inform the sustainability ratings provided by Seafood Watch, which are intended to guide consumers, businesses, and other stakeholders in making informed seafood choices that support responsible fishing practices and marine conservation efforts.

Q. Is it true that critically endangered North Atlantic Right Whales are getting Smaller according to new research findings?
GT> Aerial photos show whales three feet shorter than 40 years ago. Females entangled while nursing also produce smaller calves.

BOSTON, MASS. (June 3, 2021) – Entanglements in fishing gear and other factors are stunting the growth of North Atlantic right whales. This is leaving these critically endangered whales smaller and more vulnerable to other threats, new research shows.

The new findings were published recently in Current Biology. They reveal that even when entanglements do not lead directly to the death of North Atlantic right whales, they can have lasting effects on the imperiled population that may now number less than 400 animals. A North Atlantic right whale born today would be expected to reach a full-grown length of about  three feet shorter than one born in 1980, researchers found.

“We normally see these major life-history impacts in heavily exploited commercial species,” said Joshua Stewart, a postdoctoral researcher at NOAA Fisheries’ Southwest Fisheries Science Center and lead author of the new research. “While the average body size decline is striking, there are some truly extreme examples where five- and ten-year-old whales are shorter than a typical one or two year old.”

The calves of female North Atlantic right whales entangled while nursing also grow up to be shorter than expected, according to the research that also included scientists from the New England Aquarium, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and Oregon State University.

“This is one more piece of evidence that the health of the whales is at risk,” said Michael Moore, senior scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and a coauthor of the research. “You cannot recover them by just reducing mortality, you’ve got to pay attention to the health of individual whales and address that, too.”

Revealing Aerial Photos
Scientists used high-resolution aerial photographs from airplanes and drones to track the sizes of North Atlantic right whales in the closely studied population. “We were able to measure whales by flying a camera high above them, essentially giving them a health check without them knowing we were there,” said John Durban, an Associate Professor at Oregon State University.

The stunted growth of the whales coincides with an increasing rate of life-threatening entanglements, leaving individual animals less energy to devote toward growth. The scientists suggest that the ongoing stress of serious entanglements may reduce the reproductive rate of females, and possibly affect the survival of both calves and adults.

Entanglements did not explain all of the reduced growth, however. Other factors ranging from vessel noise to shifting availability of the tiny copepods that are their primary prey may also be contributing to their declining health. They may also make them more vulnerable to lethal entanglements.

“There is an increasing human footprint in the ocean, and it’s likely a combination of several compounding factors that are affecting the growth and life history of these vulnerable animals,” Stewart said. He said other whale populations around the world are probably experiencing similar effects from human activities. However, they are not as well-studied as North Atlantic right whales so there is less data to document it.

NOAA Fisheries has designated North Atlantic right whales as one of nine national “Species in the Spotlight” that are highly endangered and warrant focused recovery actions. An Action Plan for the species outlines priority recovery actions, including investigation of the abundance and health of the whales and how that affects their survival. There is also an ongoing Unusual Mortality Event  for North Atlantic right whales that has been underway since 2017. The primary causes of the UME are entanglements in fishing gear and vessel collisions. This data will help the UME investigation team and NOAA Fisheries understand the impacts of the mortalities and serious injuries documented.

Addressing Sub-lethal Effects
The results underscore the significance of what biologists call “sub-lethal effects.” These effects do not kill whales outright but drain their energy, making them more vulnerable to other risks, the researchers said.

The body size and condition of whales could affect reproductive rates and survival. It also affects their resilience to other impacts such as climate change and perturbations on and near feeding and breeding areas. This means that decreasing body sizes could translate into declining population trends and affect the overall outlook for North Atlantic right whales. The scientists said that management of human-related impacts on the population requires a holistic approach.

“This study highlights the need for stronger management actions to reduce the impacts of fixed-fishing gear and vessel operations to allow this species to be more resilient to the effects of climate change and, in turn, support a healthier ocean,” said Amy Knowlton, Senior Scientist in the New England Aquarium’s Right Whale Research Program and coauthor of the study. The Aquarium curates the North Atlantic Right Whale Catalog and monitors human impacts and their effects on the health of the whales using more than a million photographs. These detailed databases maintained since the 1980s were essential to the study, but such high-resolution information is rare for marine species.

“Implementing proven solutions such as reduced vessel speeds, lower breaking-strength ropes, and ropeless fishing gear more broadly throughout the range are critical and urgent steps needed to stave off the extinction of this species,” Knowlton said.
ChatGPT> As of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021, I am not aware of any credible scientific research that suggests North Atlantic right whales, which are classified as endangered, are getting smaller. However, it is important to note that scientific research is an ongoing process, and new findings may emerge that could potentially update our understanding of these species.

Research on North Atlantic right whales has primarily focused on various aspects of their population dynamics, including their abundance, distribution, reproductive success, health, and mortality rates, as well as the threats they face and conservation efforts to protect them. While changes in body size or other morphological characteristics of these whales are not typically a primary focus of research, new findings in these areas could contribute to our understanding of their biology, ecology, and conservation status.

It is important to rely on credible, peer-reviewed scientific research conducted by reputable organizations and experts in the field when interpreting findings about endangered species like North Atlantic right whales. As with any scientific research, new findings need to be validated, replicated, and considered in the broader context of existing knowledge and scientific consensus before drawing definitive conclusions. It is always recommended to consult the most up-to-date and reliable sources of scientific information for the latest findings on North Atlantic right whales or any other species of concern.

Q. What WHOI doing to help save critically endangered North Atlantic right whales?
GT> North Atlantic right whales are in crisis. There are approximately 360 individuals remaining, and with over 80% bearing scars of entanglements in fishing gear, the race to save this species is more critical than ever.

At the recent 2020 Ropeless Consortium and North Atlantic right whale annual meetings, WHOI researchers among others from the U.S and Canada, met to discuss reliable and affordable solutions. Ropeless fishing technology —the ability to retrieve gear without running a line from the surface to the bottom —presents a possible solution that could be both safe for the North Atlantic right whale and viable for the Atlantic fishing industry. Several prototypes are currently under development and some fishermen are partnering with scientists to test different ropeless fishing traps. Partners are helping in these efforts, including a grant from the SeaWorld Conservation Fund, which helped create a gear cache where offshore and inshore lobster fishermen could borrow ropeless technology to try it for themselves.

WHOI’s Michael Moore and Mark Baumgartner provide some of the expert voices on the crisis in stories from Cape Cod Times and the CBC in Canada.
ChatGPT> The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) has been actively involved in research, conservation, and advocacy efforts aimed at saving the critically endangered North Atlantic right whales. Some of the key initiatives undertaken by WHOI in support of North Atlantic right whale conservation include:

Research and Monitoring: WHOI conducts scientific research to better understand the ecology, behavior, and health of North Atlantic right whales. This includes studies on their habitat use, migration patterns, reproductive success, and health status. Monitoring efforts involve collecting data on their abundance, distribution, and movement patterns using various tools such as satellite tags, underwater acoustics, and aerial surveys.

Entanglement Mitigation: WHOI scientists have been involved in the development and testing of innovative technologies and strategies to reduce the risk of whale entanglements in fishing gear, which is one of the leading causes of mortality and serious injuries in North Atlantic right whales. This includes the use of ropeless fishing gear, gear modifications, and other innovative approaches to mitigate entanglement risks.

Acoustic Monitoring: WHOI has been using underwater acoustic monitoring to detect and track North Atlantic right whales in their habitat. Acoustic data helps in understanding their distribution, movements, and behavior, and contributes to the development of effective conservation measures.

Policy and Advocacy: WHOI engages in policy and advocacy efforts at local, national, and international levels to promote conservation measures and regulations aimed at protecting North Atlantic right whales. This includes providing scientific expertise and recommendations to inform decision-makers, participating in forums and workshops, and collaborating with other organizations and stakeholders.

Education and Outreach: WHOI conducts public education and outreach programs to raise awareness about the conservation status and challenges facing North Atlantic right whales. This includes public lectures, educational materials, and outreach campaigns aimed at promoting responsible marine stewardship and conservation.

It's important to note that the efforts of WHOI and other organizations in saving North Atlantic right whales are part of a larger collaborative effort involving various stakeholders, including governments, NGOs, fishing industries, and local communities, to work towards effective conservation measures for these critically endangered whales.

Q. Explain why right whales eat the fish larvae as the whales swim in the ocean?
GT> When viewing right whales, you might see these enormous creatures breaching and then crashing back down with a thunderous splash. You might also see them swimming along with their rostrum out of the water as they skim feed on dense patches of plankton. Right whales feed by opening their mouths while swimming slowly through large patches of copepods and other zooplankton. They filter out these tiny organisms from the water through their baleen, where the copepods become trapped in a tangle of hair-like material that acts like a sieve. Right whales feed anywhere from the water’s surface to the bottom of the water column.
Groups of right whales may be seen actively socializing at the water’s surface, known as surface-active groups, or SAGs. Mating and socializing occurs in SAGs, which are observed during all seasons and in all habitats.
Right whales communicate using low-frequency moans, groans, and pulses, which may maintain contact between individuals, communicate threats, signal aggression, or be used for other social reasons.

ChatGPT> Right whales feed on a variety of small organisms, including fish larvae, krill, copepods, and amphipods. They typically feed by swimming through the water with their mouths open, filtering out small prey items with their baleen plates.
One reason why right whales may target fish larvae is that they are a rich source of nutrients. Larvae are often high in protein, which can help the whales build and maintain their bodies. Additionally, larvae may be easier to catch than some other types of prey, as they are relatively slow-moving and often form dense aggregations.
It is also possible that right whales feed on fish larvae opportunistically, taking advantage of whatever prey items happen to be available in their environment. Right whales are known to feed in areas where large concentrations of zooplankton are present, and fish larvae may simply be a common type of prey in these areas.
Overall, the exact reasons why right whales feed on fish larvae are likely complex and multifaceted, and may vary depending on a variety of factors, including the availability of prey and the nutritional needs of the whales.

Q. Explain why and what happen right whales eat the fish larvae as the whales swim in the ocean?

When right whales eat fish larvae as they swim in the ocean, they take in water and prey through their mouths. The water is then pushed out through their baleen plates, which trap the small prey items inside their mouths. The whales use their tongue and throat muscles to push the trapped prey further into their mouths and then swallow them.

However, the ingestion of plastics and other pollutants has become a major threat to right whales and other marine species. When plastic and other debris are in the ocean, they can be mistaken for food and ingested by marine animals, causing serious health problems or even death. Therefore, it is crucial to reduce the amount of plastic and other pollutants in the ocean to protect right whales and other marine species.

Q. What is the population distribution of north atlantic right whales now?
ChapGPT> As of the latest information available (September 2021), the North Atlantic right whale population is estimated to be around 356 individuals. This is a critically endangered species, with a population decline of approximately 25% since 2010.

The population distribution of North Atlantic right whales is concentrated in the western North Atlantic, with the majority of individuals found along the eastern coast of North America, from Florida to Atlantic Canada. This area is known as the species' calving and feeding grounds, and it is important for the whales' survival and recovery.

However, due to a range of threats, including entanglement in fishing gear, vessel strikes, and noise pollution, the range of the North Atlantic right whale population has been contracting in recent years. In particular, the species has experienced high mortality rates in recent years, with over 30 individuals dying between 2017 and 2021. As a result, conservation efforts are underway to protect the remaining population and help the species recover.

Q. What is the role of ocean in global climate and regional weather patterns?
GT> Through its food webs and chemical reactions, the ocean helps to regulate Earth's climate by taking up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and moving a fraction of that carbon through the ocean twilight zone to the deep ocean, where it can remain sequestered out of the atmosphere for hundreds or even thousands of years. The ocean also absorbs heat: ocean waters have absorbed most of human-caused global warming.

The ocean also plays an important role in regional weather patterns. The saltiness of surface water in one part of the ocean has been linked to rainfall patterns on land thousands of miles away. Surface water temperature can help predict the intensity of storms—something scientists have learned by launching temperature probes from military aircraft into the path of a hurricanes.

In turn, a warming global climate is affecting the ocean in significant ways, through shifts in major currents, sea level rise, and changes in water temperature, pH, salinity, and productivity. Climate change is visible in Greenland's receding ice sheet and declines in Antarctic wildlife, but also in the "super corals" that have found the means to survive in a warming ocean. The ocean preserves records of past changes in climate and weather—in its sediments, in coral skeletons, and even in whaling log books—just as present-day commercial fishers bear witness to ocean warming and its impacts on fisheries.

Using sophisticated computer models, satellite remote sensing, and long-term datasets, scientists can analyze interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere to better understand climate and weather patterns on a variety of timescales. Climate change is the environmental crisis of our time, and understanding the ocean's role in climate is essential to mitigating its impacts—for our ocean, our planet, and our future.
ChatGPT> The oceans play a crucial role in global climate and regional weather patterns through a variety of processes. Here are some key roles of the oceans in shaping climate and weather:

Heat Storage and Redistribution: The oceans act as a vast heat sink, storing and redistributing heat around the globe. They absorb and store large amounts of heat from the Sun, which helps to regulate Earth's temperature. The heat is transported by ocean currents, such as the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic, which can carry warm water from the tropics to higher latitudes, influencing regional weather patterns.

Evaporation and Precipitation: The oceans are the largest source of moisture for the atmosphere through evaporation. Warm ocean waters evaporate, releasing water vapor into the atmosphere, which then condenses to form clouds and precipitation. This process drives the global water cycle and influences regional weather patterns, as precipitation patterns are largely determined by the availability of oceanic moisture.

Oceanic Circulation and Currents: Ocean currents are driven by a combination of factors, including temperature, salinity, and wind patterns. These currents help to distribute heat around the globe and can affect regional climate and weather patterns. For example, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, which involves changes in ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean, can influence weather patterns around the world, including changes in precipitation patterns, temperature, and storm tracks.

Influence on Atmospheric CO2 Levels: The oceans also play a role in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, which is a major greenhouse gas that influences global climate. The oceans act as a sink, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere through a process known as oceanic uptake. This process helps to regulate the balance of CO2 in the atmosphere, but it can also result in ocean acidification, which can have negative impacts on marine ecosystems and their ability to absorb CO2.

Interaction with Land: The interactions between the oceans and land also play a role in regional weather patterns. Ocean currents can influence the climate of coastal regions, affecting temperature, precipitation, and even the formation of fog. Coastal landforms, such as mountains, can also affect the formation of ocean currents and weather patterns.

Overall, the oceans play a critical role in shaping global climate and regional weather patterns through their heat storage and redistribution, evaporation and precipitation, oceanic circulation and currents, influence on atmospheric CO2 levels, and interactions with land. Understanding these processes is crucial for predicting and managing climate and weather patterns, as well as addressing climate change impacts.

Q. What does biodiversity do for us?
GT> We’ve spoken about the mental health benefits of outdoor spaces such as national parks, but this is only the tip of the iceberg with regards to what green spaces can bring to the table. The big one is biodiversity. Earth's wildlife populations have plunged by an average of 69% in just under 50 years, so any protected area that can maintain species of plants and animals is vital to the biodiversity crisis. But what exactly is biodiversity, and why is it seen as such an important thing to conserve? Will Tingle met up with The Wildlife Trusts' Iain Webb to answer these questions. Well, if they could stop birdwatching for long enough, that is…

Will - I cannot promise that this interview won't be interrupted by an impromptu birdwatch.

Iain - Okay, fair enough.

Will - That's just the nature of the beast, unfortunately.

Iain - Yeah, that's okay. That's why we're here.

Will - Well, when we talk about biodiversity, we hear it. It's a buzzword. We hear it a lot in the news. 'Low levels of biodiversity. This needs to improve our biodiversity.' Is that just the number of animals that are in a place or is there more to it than that?

Iain - Well, obviously the number of animals or plants in this place is important. But it's also whether those species are expected to be there, whether there could be more species there in that sort of natural system. And it's also the populations of those species as well. You could have lots of different species, but only two or three breeding pairs or whatever. And that's not really a healthy ecosystem. You really need it as natural as possible where the natural systems are allowed to occur, where populations interact, go up and down and aren't needing to have support by people in maintaining them.

Will - Does the biodiversity of national parks have a kind of bleed out effect so that the organisms living there tend to move outwards and perhaps improve the levels of biodiversity in nearby regions?

Iain - Yes, they do. They can act as a biodiversity source. So if the habitats are healthy within those national parks and species increase in number, in good numbers, then they will spill out. The one example quite obvious is not necessarily national parks as such, but marine protected areas where there's been long-term protection or certainly severe limitations on the extraction of fish, et cetera. Resources from these areas and those fish populations, those crustacean populations are crabs and lobsters. Those populations increase individuals that increase in size and then that protection encourages the migration of those species out of the protected area. And then it's therefore available to those people who collect those resources to then be used by people living nearby. So that's an obvious indication of where we can utilize for our own consumption, the value of national parks and the surrounding areas. But obviously there is value in enhancing habitats and species and ecosystems for the other natural capital, if you want to call it that. So like cleaning the air. If you think about on the larger scale, you know, the tipping point of losing 20% of the Amazon. The Amazon produces its own rainfall. And when you lose a certain portion of it we get less rainfall in the area and it'll become savannah and that sort of a tipping point away from tropical rainforests. National parks if managed well and are able to support good numbers of species, then those species will spread up.

Will - And there's the obvious one, that they are a massive contributor towards the fight against climate change.

Iain - Oh yeah. Good quality, diverse habitats will help sequester and store carbon for decades, centuries, millennia, even in certain habitats. So the more diverse, the more rich habitats there are, the greater sink, those habitats act to absorb carbon dioxide. More biodiversity there is around, there's more carbon locked up, whether it be in soils, in plant matter itself, in animal matter. So yeah, it is really key to not just reduce our fossil fuel use, but to make sure there are natural habitats to absorb that carbon. They can do far, much more than just absorbing carbon. They provide a nice opportunity to walk in the afternoon sunshine as they're doing now, but also food production, medicine, flood alleviation, timber products, all these sort of things. All the things that we've actually, we have evolved from biodiverse habitats and have exploited them for millennia. So it is key not to forget that we do need that, even though we feel that we are technologically removed from nature, we still need it completely and utterly in its healthiest, most diverse form.

Will - Do you think access to nature increases people's willingness or wantingness to get involved in, you know, maintaining biodiversity projects such as that?

Iain - Definitely. You're not going to want to protect something you don't understand or you don't love. And I think the lockdowns made people go outside more and really appreciate what's surrounding them. You can watch various wildlife documentaries on the telly, but it's always stuff overseas and it's only the stuff really that's right on your doorstep that is really key, really important that you can connect with every day or see it change throughout the seasons that is fundamentally vital for your mental health.

Will - Glad we held it together for the whole of that interview. Did you hear the woodpecker going over there?

Iain - I didn't. Was it?

Will - Ah, it was good. Yeah.

Iain - I was too focused on the saying the right thing <laugh>

Will - I found a green woodpecker nest...
ChatGPT> Biodiversity, which refers to the variety of life on Earth, provides numerous benefits to humanity, often referred to as ecosystem services. Here are some important ways in which biodiversity benefits us:

Supporting Food and Agriculture: Biodiversity is the foundation of food and agriculture systems. A wide range of plant and animal species provide food, fiber, and other resources that sustain human populations. Crop diversity, including wild relatives of cultivated crops, is essential for maintaining resilient agricultural systems that are able to adapt to changing environmental conditions and pests. Biodiversity also plays a key role in pollination, which is crucial for the production of many fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.

Supporting Medicine and Health: Biodiversity is a rich source of medicines and other natural products that are used to develop pharmaceuticals and health treatments. Many of our modern medicines are derived from or inspired by natural compounds found in plants, animals, and microorganisms. Biodiversity also provides opportunities for traditional and indigenous medicinal knowledge, which has been used for generations by local communities to treat various ailments.

Supporting Economic and Livelihoods: Biodiversity contributes to local and global economies by providing livelihood opportunities for millions of people. Many communities around the world depend on biodiversity for their subsistence, livelihoods, and cultural practices, including through fishing, hunting, gathering, and ecotourism. Biodiversity also supports economic sectors such as forestry, fisheries, agriculture, and ecotourism, generating income, employment, and economic development.

Supporting Ecosystem Functions and Resilience: Biodiversity is essential for maintaining healthy ecosystems and their functions. Ecosystems provide services such as climate regulation, water purification, soil formation, and nutrient cycling, which are crucial for supporting human well-being. Biodiversity also contributes to ecosystem resilience, helping ecosystems to withstand disturbances, such as extreme weather events, climate change, and invasive species.

Cultural and Recreational Values: Biodiversity has cultural and recreational values, providing inspiration, aesthetics, and recreational opportunities for people. Biodiversity is often intertwined with cultural and spiritual beliefs, practices, and traditions, and provides a sense of place and identity for many communities. Biodiversity also supports recreational activities such as birdwatching, hiking, camping, and wildlife viewing, contributing to human well-being and quality of life.

Climate Change Mitigation: Biodiversity plays a role in climate change mitigation by sequestering carbon and regulating the carbon cycle. Forests, for example, are important carbon sinks that absorb and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping to regulate global climate. Protecting and restoring biodiverse ecosystems can contribute to climate change mitigation efforts by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing carbon sequestration.

Overall, biodiversity provides a wide range of benefits to humanity, including supporting food and agriculture, medicine and health, economic and livelihoods, ecosystem functions and resilience, cultural and recreational values, and climate change mitigation. Protecting and conserving biodiversity is crucial for maintaining these benefits and ensuring a sustainable and resilient future for people and the planet.

Q. Will seagrass adapt to climate change?
GT> Seagrass is a vital source of carbon storage. In fact some species of seagrass are able to capture carbon 35 times faster than areas of tropical rainforest. Even so, seagrass only covers 0.2% of the seafloor and so maintaining its existence is paramount to fighting climate change and preserving species. Emmett Duffy, from the Smithsonian Institution, has been speaking to Will Tingle on the importance of seagrass to both marine ecosystems and humans alike, as well as the new research highlighting how climatic pressures could affect their populations going forward…

Emmett - I think of sea grasses as the Serengeti of the sea. These are big expanses of underwater grasslands that are also highly productive and support lots of wildlife, as grasslands do on land and the foundation of these ecosystems are sea grasses. These are not algae or seaweeds, but flowering plants with roots that invaded the sea millions of years ago. They are critical to ocean wildlife, lots of large animals - dugongs, manatees, sea turtles depend on sea grasses. They're also essential nurseries for fishes, and particularly in parts of the developing world. Many people in coastal regions get a large part of their protein from fishes and shellfish that live in seagrass beds. And finally, they, uh, soak up carbon that our industrial society is exhaling into the atmosphere. So there's a lot of interest in so-called blue carbon capture by sea grasses.

Will - In the research paper, it's stated that there are two populations of eelgrass, one found in the Pacific and one found in the Atlantic. What is sort of so notably distinct between these two populations and how was that difference found?

Emmett - Yeah, a big surprise from our research was finding how different the seagrass looked in the two oceans. Eelgrass is distributed globally around the Northern hemisphere. And so understanding what makes it tick is a global problem. And we needed a global team. So we got 50 of our colleagues around the world together to sample the eelgrass using the same methods. So it would be comparable and we measured both the size and density and shape of the eelgrass, but also the genetic structure. We've known that there is a lot of genetic separation among various populations of eelgrass, which occurs all over the Northern hemisphere. But we found that the seagrass in the Atlantic was consistently shorter and denser. It lives in what we would call Meadows, whereas in much of the Pacific it's closer to forests.

Will - And was there any noticeable difference between the genetic strength between the two populations?

Emmett - Yes. So eelgrass originated, it evolved originally in the Pacific ocean and there's lots of genetic variation there because that's its ancestral Homeland, so to speak. And then sometime during the Pleistocene between ice ages, the eelgrass moved through the Arctic and colonized the Atlantic. And that probably involved only a small number of plants because the genetic diversity of eelgrass in the Atlantic is much smaller than it is in the Pacific. And what we've found is that much smaller genetic variation in the Atlantic is associated with this meadow like growth form. And so probably what happened is that the pioneers who made it across the difficult journey through the Arctic were small stature plants. Meadow forming plants from the edge of the Pacific.

Will - So with these two separate populations. If one is less genetically diverse or complex than one other region, do you think that the population in the Atlantic may be at more risk from climate change or other dangers to their existence?

Emmett - What we know is that the growth form of the eelgrass in the Atlantic seems to be constrained to being relatively short. However, the good news is that eelgrass is highly adaptable. It lives in all kinds of environments from open ocean coasts to the inner Baltic Sea and from the Arctic to Baja, California, for example. So it seems to be able to adapt reasonably well to different climates. It should be able to make it very well if we can control water quality and overfishing,

Will - These seagrasses sound like essential parts of the ecosystem to protect if they're so vital to Marine ecosystems and to our own food supplies. So what is the best course of action that you or I could do to help preserve these seagrass colonies?

Emmett - The biggest threat to eelgrass and other sea grasses throughout most of the world is coastal development and particularly poor water quality. These plants need a lot of light, so they need clear water and they only grow, uh, for, in most places in relatively shallow water. And we've seen success stories in Chesapeake Bay, in the United States, in Tampa bay, in the United States and a few other places where controlling runoff and pollution of the water has allowed the sea grasses to rebound and grow back again. So the best thing we can do is keep the water clear. And of course that has lots of other benefits as well.
ChatGPT> Seagrasses are complex and diverse marine ecosystems that are important for coastal communities and marine biodiversity. Like other ecosystems, seagrasses are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including rising temperatures, ocean acidification, sea level rise, and changes in weather patterns. However, whether seagrasses will be able to adapt to climate change remains uncertain and depends on various factors.

Seagrasses have some characteristics that may enable them to adapt to changing conditions:

Genetic diversity: Seagrasses exhibit genetic diversity within and among populations, which can provide the basis for adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Genetic diversity allows for variation in traits such as tolerance to temperature, salinity, and other stressors, which can help seagrasses to adapt to changing conditions.

Phenotypic plasticity: Seagrasses also have the ability to change their traits in response to environmental conditions through phenotypic plasticity. For example, seagrasses can adjust their leaf morphology or photosynthetic pathways in response to changing light availability or temperature.

Migration and dispersal: Seagrasses have the ability to migrate and disperse, which can allow them to track changing environmental conditions. Seagrasses produce seeds or other propagules that can be dispersed by water currents, allowing them to colonize new areas and potentially adapt to changing conditions.

However, there are also several challenges and limitations to seagrass adaptation to climate change:

Rate of change: Climate change is occurring at an accelerated rate, which may exceed the ability of seagrasses to adapt through genetic changes, phenotypic plasticity, and migration. Rapid changes in environmental conditions can outpace the ability of seagrasses to adapt, leading to declines in seagrass populations.

Multiple stressors: Seagrasses are also exposed to multiple stressors in addition to climate change, such as pollution, coastal development, and overfishing, which can weaken their ability to cope with changing environmental conditions and reduce their adaptive capacity.

Local and regional variability: The ability of seagrasses to adapt to climate change may vary depending on local and regional conditions, such as water temperature, salinity, nutrient availability, and sediment dynamics. Some seagrass populations may be better able to adapt to changing conditions than others, depending on their specific environmental context.

Human interventions: Human interventions, such as coastal development, dredging, and pollution, can disrupt seagrass ecosystems and hinder their ability to adapt to climate change. For example, habitat destruction and degradation can reduce genetic diversity, disrupt dispersal, and limit seagrass migration, making it more challenging for them to adapt.

In conclusion, while seagrasses have some inherent characteristics that may enable them to adapt to climate change, there are also challenges and limitations. The ability of seagrasses to adapt to changing environmental conditions will depend on various factors, including their genetic diversity, phenotypic plasticity, migration and dispersal abilities, the rate of climate change, the presence of multiple stressors, local and regional variability, and human interventions. Protecting and conserving seagrass ecosystems, reducing other stressors, and managing coastal areas sustainably can help enhance their resilience and ability to adapt to climate change.

Q. What challenges will we face because of sea level rise and global population increases?
GT> One impact of climate change - and one that we’re beginning to see already - is a rising rate of migration as people move from parts of the globe imperiled by the consequences of a changing climate. That means more people converging on areas that do remain habitable, inevitably driving urbanisation and habitation density and therefore the risks of food and water shortages, and outbreaks of disease. So what role does human population play in all this? With us is Kathleen Mogelgaard from the Population Institute, a non-profit based in Washington, DC, with a missions to "achieve a world population in balance with a healthy global environment and resource base."

Chris - Well, Kathleen, let's begin by looking at the scale of the problem to start with. How many humans do we think there are on earth right now?

Kathleen - The world's population is currently about 7.8 billion people, and it's growing every year. It's continuing, continuing to grow by about 80 million people per year.

Chris - What's that in percentage terms, then?

Kathleen - The population growth rate is right around 1% globally. But of course, when you look at different countries around the world, that percentage growth rate varies quite a bit. We have some countries that are not growing at all. We have a handful of countries that are actually declining in their population. And then we have a set of countries that are growing quite a bit more rapidly than 1% upwards toward 2 and 3% in some places.

Chris - I'm just trying to think about what a 1% growth translates into, because if you, if you work that out, because of course there's 1% this year and then next year, there's 1% on top of the 1% that's just happened. And then the year after that - and so on and so forth, that that would actually translate into quite a considerable growth after not very many years, wouldn't it?

Kathleen - It certainly would. And you know, this is the business of demographers to try to understand where our population is likely to grow in the future. But there are lots of factors that we need to consider when we think about how quickly populations grow and why. And certainly there is a worldwide trend with population growth rates slowing down. We're seeing births around the world still continuing to slow. Although the birth rate is slowing in some places more quickly than in others. So demographers do their best to try to understand how all of these trends come together, including the ways in which development is proceeding. Because we know for example, as girls receive more years of education, as women have greater access to reproductive health and family planning services and greater economic opportunities, you know, all of these areas where we see gender equity improving, then we also see population growth rates slowing. So it's a real task to try to understand how all of these factors come together, that lead toward population growth futures.

Chris - I've just been scribbling while you were talking. It's about a 1% growth about a doubling in the lifetime of the average person listening to this program. So in about 72 years, that's twice as many people than there are right now, if we wait another 72 years and continue to grow at 1%. There's already 8 billion. You're saying that that cannot be sustainable. So what's going to happen?

Kathleen - It's really difficult to predict what is going to happen, but it's really important for us to think about population growth and other population dynamics and how that interacts with our day-to-day lives. And certainly as the world is turning its attention toward tackling the climate crisis, understanding population dynamics and how that relates both to the growth of greenhouse gas emissions, as well as to the vulnerability of human populations around the world, to the impacts of climate change. It's a really important endeavor to understand these demographic trends and to be able to plan for them. We know, for example, that some of the countries that are the most vulnerable to climate change impacts, whether it's the kinds of climate change impacts you were talking about earlier in the program with storm surges and floods, or whether it's the kind of slow onset climate change impacts like multiple years of drought that cause lots of challenges for agriculture, when communities become more food-insecure and that the climate is changing in ways that makes farming very difficult, we know that more and more people will be on the move around the globe. And it's important for us to be able to anticipate that and think about ways that we can make that kind of migration around the world happen in ways that really advances and protects people's human health and wellbeing.

Chris - Are you slightly surprised then given that there has been a lot of hot air, which is ironic from a conference about climate change coming from COP26, and really the only person who has alluded to the population issue is David Attenborough. There have not been very many voices saying this, is that just because people are uncomfortable talking about it, or is it just that people are overlooking the issue?

Kathleen - It's a really good question. That's a difficult question to answer. I think there is a, in many, among many of us, there is a lack of awareness of demographic trends, just how quickly the world's population continues to grow in some areas. I think among some people, they feel like the population problems were a thing of the past, and now we're in some parts of the world worrying about population decline. So I think it's not as much on people's minds as it used to be. But of course we are seeing in many places of the world this ongoing rapid population growth. And when that is combined with climate change vulnerability, the kinds of impacts of climate change that we are likely to see, this is going to have implications for movements of people and the health and safety and wellbeing of people and the planet. So I think it is a really important part of the climate change conversation, but of course, the way our climate change policies are structured, it's done in a somewhat siloed way. So we think a lot about the kinds of technologies that can be put in place to reduce emissions, and even when we're talking about climate change adaptation, you know, the ways in which society will be able to cope with the impacts of climate change, a lot of that discussion centres around some of the hard infrastructure that we were talking about earlier in the program, whether that's sea walls or other kinds of things that will enable communities to be able to cope with flooding or heat waves or extreme weather events. And these kind of longer term trends that relate to the growth of our population and the movement of people are not necessarily on the radars of folks who are thinking about the immediate challenges of adapting to climate change impacts.

Chris - We've got about a minute left, Kathleen. Does the way in which we've really constructed the world economically though, act as something of a barrier to trying to control population? Because if you look at what happened in China, where they had a one child policy that's been reversed because it turned out, you ended up with one poor child trying to sustain two aging parents. And so you ended up with a young married couple with four aging parents trying to be supported between them. So once we sort of get to a population level, it's very hard to row back from that. And we're already, some people say, burning off two planet Earths with resources per year, not one which means we're already well in breach of your mission statement.

Kathleen - I'm really glad you brought up the example of China, Chris. I think it's really, that is a lesson to us about the ways in which population control measures are really a fool's errand. And what we need to be thinking about more is really expanding the rights of people, particularly the rights of women and girls. Around the world, there are hundreds of millions of women who would like to be able to delay childbearing or end childbearing, but they don't have meaningful access to the information and services that would enable them to avoid a pregnancy. And until we really are able to fully meet those needs for women around the world, talking about any kind of top-down population control measure is not, makes no sense from a rights perspective or from an efficacy perspective. If we were able to really fully meet the needs of women and girls around the world, we would see a dramatic slowing of population growth rates. Fertility would decline and we might see population, we might see an end and a slowing or reversal of population growth within this century, but without it, I'm afraid we are headed for a much more crowded world.

Chris - Kathleen, thank you for crystallizing it so well for us. That's Kathleen Mogelgaard from the Population Institute.

ChatGPT> Sea level rise and global population increases can pose significant challenges for coastal areas and communities, including:

Coastal flooding and erosion: Sea level rise can result in increased coastal flooding and erosion, which can threaten coastal infrastructure, properties, and habitats. Higher sea levels can exacerbate storm surges and increase the frequency and severity of coastal flooding events, leading to damage to coastal communities, loss of property, and displacement of people. Coastal erosion can also accelerate due to rising sea levels, resulting in loss of land and habitat.

Displacement of human populations: Sea level rise can lead to the displacement of human populations, particularly in low-lying coastal areas. As sea levels rise, coastal communities may face the need to relocate or adapt to changing conditions, which can result in social, economic, and cultural disruptions. Displacement of communities can also lead to conflicts over land and resources, loss of livelihoods, and challenges in finding suitable relocation areas.

Impacts on freshwater resources: Rising sea levels can also impact freshwater resources in coastal areas. Saltwater intrusion into freshwater aquifers and estuaries can contaminate drinking water supplies and agricultural lands, reducing their availability and quality. This can lead to challenges in meeting the water needs of growing populations in coastal areas, and may require costly infrastructure adaptations to secure freshwater supplies.

Loss of coastal ecosystems: Coastal ecosystems, such as salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrasses, provide critical habitat for many species and play a key role in buffering against coastal erosion, storm surges, and sea level rise. However, rising sea levels can lead to the loss of these ecosystems, resulting in declines in biodiversity, loss of ecosystem services, and reduced coastal resilience.

Increased vulnerability to extreme weather events: Rising sea levels can increase the vulnerability of coastal communities to extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons. Higher sea levels can exacerbate storm surges and flooding associated with these events, leading to more frequent and severe impacts on coastal communities, including damage to infrastructure, loss of property, and threats to human safety.

Pressure on coastal resources and infrastructure: Global population increases can also result in increased pressure on coastal resources and infrastructure. As more people move to coastal areas, there may be higher demand for land, water, food, energy, and other resources, leading to increased competition, conflicts, and challenges in managing and sustainably using coastal resources. Increased population density in coastal areas can also strain infrastructure, such as roads, ports, and utilities, leading to challenges in planning, managing, and maintaining coastal infrastructure.

Environmental and social justice issues: Sea level rise and global population increases can exacerbate existing environmental and social justice issues. Vulnerable communities, including low-income and marginalized populations, may face disproportionate impacts from sea level rise and population increases due to limited access to resources, information, and infrastructure. There may also be differential impacts on vulnerable groups, such as indigenous communities, who rely on coastal resources for their cultural and subsistence needs. Addressing equity and social justice issues in the context of sea level rise and global population increases is an important challenge that needs to be addressed in coastal planning and management.

In summary, sea level rise and global population increases pose significant challenges for coastal areas and communities, including coastal flooding and erosion, displacement of human populations, impacts on freshwater resources, loss of coastal ecosystems, increased vulnerability to extreme weather events, pressure on coastal resources and infrastructure, and environmental and social justice issues. These challenges require integrated and sustainable approaches to coastal management, including measures to mitigate and adapt to sea level rise, promote equitable access to resources and opportunities, and protect coastal ecosystems and communities.

Q. How some creatures in the Antarctic, like sea spiders grow to giant sizes?
GT> Lloyd Peck of the British Antarctic Survey explains how some creatures in the Antarctic, like sea spiders, grow to giant sizes!

Chris -   Lloyd, so, you work in Antarctica.  It's not Sea Spider - Pycnogonidvery Antarctic in here today.  In fact, it's approaching 9 million degrees because we've had to turn the aircon off, but tell us about your work!

Lloyd -   I've got a group that works in the Antarctic and some of those people there now, at Rothera station currently, it's over 30 degrees here and where there now, it's between about minus 15 and minus 20.  So, there's almost a 50-degree difference between where I do most of my work at the moment and the temperature we have here.  I'm really interested in how animals not only survive in low temperatures, but actually thrive in those environments and why they are different and how different they are, and I have some examples of that.

Chris -   When you say you've got some examples of these animals, what have you got with you there?

Lloyd -   Well, some of the animals and some of the adaptations that we have in the Antarctic are very unusual.  So, one of the best examples I guess is, there's a group of animals that live around the coast of the UK and you've all been on holiday to the seashore.  You've all looked in rock pools and there are animals in those rock pools called sea spiders.  One of the biggest sea spiders in the UK is that animal there.

Chris -   Hang on.  That's your...

Lloyd -   That's on the end of my finger.

Chris -   ...index finger.

Lloyd -   Yes.

Chris -   And there's a tiny speck that you stuck on the end of your finger.

Lloyd -   It's sitting on the end of my finger.  It's about 5 mm across and okay, its legs are curled up so that when it's up and walking around, it's maybe as much as a centimetre across.  And if you've looked in rock pools around the country, you will all have seen this animal.

Chris -   So, what does it actually look like if we sort of put a magnifying glass on there?  What do we see?

Lloyd -   They look like an 8-legged spider.  They look a little bit more chunky than most spiders.  Their legs are a little bit thicker.  Their bodies are a little bit more chunky than that but they do look a lot like a spider.

Chris -   Are they really spiders?

Lloyd -   No, they're not spiders.  They're a related group to spiders.  Say, there's a big group of animals generally called - the scientific name for them is chelicerates.  But in that group, you've got scorpions, terrestrial spiders, and sea spiders.  They're called chelicerates because these organs hanging down under their bodies that are hooked that are called cheli.  Our sea spiders use those chelis to carry their eggs around while they're developing their eggs.

Chris -   But, they don't make webs in the sea.

Lloyd -   They don't make webs in the sea, no.  There are some terrestrial spiders that live in the sea.  They live subtidally and they pull air down from the surface and make little bubbles on the seabed and live in those with their webs.  But these are sea spiders.  They don't do that.

Chris -   But that's not - if I'm honest - and don't take this the wrong way,  that's not very impressive as a specimen.

Lloyd -   That's one of the biggest European sea spiders.

Chris -   Well, that's what I mean.  It's not very impressive.

Lloyd -   Okay, now we have sea spiders in the Antarctic.

Chris -   Okay.  [laughter]

Lloyd -   Now, this sea spider is about 20 cm from leg tip to leg tip and it's not one of the biggest sea spiders from Antarctica.  The biggest sea spiders in Antarctica grow up to 50 cm from leg tip to leg tip.

Chris -   I mean, to be fair, that's the size of a dinner plate.  That's big.

Lloyd -   My dinner plate's are bigger than this, but it is the fair size.

Chris -   Big eater...

Lloyd -   Okay, it's a big animal, yeah.

Chris -   Certainly, it is.

Lloyd -   The biggest sea spiders in Antarctica are 3,000 times heavier than the biggest sea spiders in Europe, around the UK, in North America, in all the temporal latitudes.

Chris -   What does that eat?

Lloyd -   This species eats limpets.   They chase limpets around the seabed.  They catch limpets and they eat limpets.  They have a proboscis that they push under the side of the shell and they eat the limpet from underneath.  But sea spiders eat lots of different things depending on the species.  

The blue ice covering Lake Fryxell, in the Transantarctic MountainsAnd the reason they get big is because it's cold.  The cold allows them to get a lot bigger for two reasons.  One is that you need to spend energy to keep your body alive.  The bigger your body, the more energy it costs.  But when it's cold and you're a cold blooded animal, your metabolic rate is very low because the low temperature pushes your metabolic rate down.  So, the cost for each piece of tissue is a lot less.  The metabolic rates of these animals are 30 times lower than similar animals in the tropics.

Chris -   Does it also help them Lloyd, the fact that because it's really cold, there's so much oxygen in the water because when the temperature of water is lower, you can dissolve more gas in it when it's hot, can't you?

Lloyd -   There's roughly twice as much oxygen in a litre of seawater in the Antarctic as the tropics.  So, there's more oxygen available to fuel your metabolism.  The metabolic rate is lower, the costs are lower, the two trade-off together to make much bigger animals in some groups.  We have a group of animals that were related to wood lice, isopods that grow up to about 14 or 15 cm long.  It's another group where we see giant size.  So, gigantism is one thing that happens at low temperature.  It also means because their metabolic rates are low, that if things go bad, they can just sit and wait.  We've done experiments with some predatory snails offering all the food types they like and some of them have eaten nothing for 3 years - and they're still walking around the tank, they're still reproducing, they're still interacting with each other.  The average number of males was one male every 11 months.  So, if things go bad, you can just wait for them to get better.

Chris -   I mean, that's nearly as bad as a Cambridge University student.

Lloyd -   Well, the alcohol is not available for our animals in the aquarium, but the food is limited, yeah.

Chris -   Are there any other animals that are also huge like that or are these the exception?  Is this sort of the rule down Antarctic?

Lloyd -   Sea spiders are one of the best examples that we have and there are no lobsters and that type of animal in the Antarctic to be predators.  So, sea spiders have radiated out and there are lots more sea spider species in the Antarctic and elsewhere.  We have 10 legged groups and 12 legged groups that you don't have anywhere else.  But there are other groups.  We have ctenophores, sea gooseberries that look like gooseberries in most oceans of the world.  They get up to about 80 cm long in the Antarctic and are much, much bigger than a rugby ball.  So, there are lots of groups that do get bigger, but not everything does get bigger.  There's got to be an ecological reason why large size is an advantage before they do get to that large size.

Chris -   But there've been some reports off the coast of Cornwall recently of these barrel jellyfish that are a meter across.  So, you don't just have to live in really cold water to get big though, do you?

Lloyd -   The biggest jellyfish in the Antarctic are even bigger than that.  I've seen one, 140 feet long and 2 meters across in the bell.  But the size is relative to the architecture of the animal, but also then temperature has an effect on how big that architecture can be.

Chris -   Do they sting?

Lloyd -   Yes, they do.

Chris -   Painful?

Lloyd -   Well, when I'm diving in the Antarctic, it's cold and I wear a full dry suit, so it doesn't matter how much it stings.  It doesn't get through the dry suit and I've never handled one with gloves off, so maybe.  I don't know.

Chris -   I think you should try, Lloyd.  Any questions for Lloyd so far?

Bob -   Hi.  I'm Bob from Godmanchester.  Thinking about temperature and keeping warm enough, how does being in the sea compare to being up on land in the Antarctic because up on land, you've got the wind, but under the water, you've got the water around you rather than air which is better at sucking the heat out of you?

Lloyd -   You're absolutely right.  There are very different adaptations on land and in the sea.  If you're a warm blooded animal then heat loss is a big problem at low temperatures.  Most animals, most of the warm blooded animals, the seals for instance use fat as an insulator.  The fattest animals on the planet are in the Antarctic.  The elephant seals are maybe 45% fat and the biggest elephant seals are 3 tons.  So, that's 3 times the biggest shire horse you've ever seen.  And they keep warm by having lots of fat.  If you're cold blooded then you're the same temperature as the environment.  In the sea and on the land, that's a very different problem because the land gets down to certainly minus 20, minus 30 and you have to be able to survive those low temperatures that you don't have in the sea.  You'll also have dehydration as a problem.

Chris -   We're talking about really cold stuff.  You've got in your experiment.

Lloyd -   Yeah, so animals on the land, really good question, have lots of ways of surviving really cold temperatures.  One is to use anti-freeze, but we have an example of another mechanism here and what I want is somebody from the audience to come out and stand close to where we are now.  Can we have a volunteer?  Come on.

Ginny -   Yeah, got someone over here.  What's your name?

Jessica -   Jessica.

Ginny -   Jessica, okay brilliant.  If you come and stand with me here.  So, I can see a big machine there that's making quite a lot of noise.  What have you got going on here?

Lloyd -   Well, what we've got is, we've got a chiller, a cooling unit.  In that cooling unit, I've got some beakers with a liquid in.  Here's a colourless liquid and what I want you to do is tell me what that temperature says on our thermometer that's in one of our beakers.  There's a minus...

Jessica -   27.

Lloyd -   Oh no, 2.7.  There's a dot.  So, the temperature in this beaker is minus 2.7.

Ginny -   So, what does that look like?  What can you see in there?

Jessica -   It looks like water.

Ginny -   Is it water?

Lloyd -   So, what happens to water when you take it down to minus 2.7?

Jessica -   It turns into ice.

Lloyd -   Is this ice?

Jessica -   No.

Ginny -   He's just drunk it.

Lloyd -   Do you want some, Ginny?

Ginny -   Go on then.  I'm not sure I believe that it's water because if it's minus 2.7, that's definitely still a liquid.  That shouldn't be happening.

Lloyd -   It should be ice, shouldn't it, but it's not.  You could try some and drink some and tell me what you think.

Ginny -   Okay, it's definitely water.  It's not vodka.  I thought you might be tricking me.

Lloyd -   No, okay and it's minus 2.7.  So, if I drop a piece of ice inside, you can start to see that ice grows in the water around the piece of ice.  Can you see that?

Jessica -   Yeah.

Ginny -   So, what can you see around the ice?

Jessica -   Spikes.

Ginny -   It looks like little spikes are coming out from the ice and the piece is getting bigger, isn't it?

Jessica -   Mm-hmm.

Ginny -   You dropped in a tiny weeny piece of ice and now, the ice is almost kind of half-filling the beaker.  What's happening?

Lloyd -   You can see ice growing before your very eyes in the water.  Shall we do that again?  Here's another one, minus 2.7.  Do you want to tell people how fast the ice grows when I drop this little piece of ice inside?  Here we go.

Jessica -   Very fast.

Lloyd -   So the question is, what's going on?  The answer is, this is called supercooling.  If you take water out of your taps and put it into your freezer, it freezes at 0 degrees.  The reason it freezes at 0 degrees is, there are lots of impurities in the water that ice crystal starts to grow on.  

If you take all of those impurities out then there's nothing for the ice to grow on and the ice won't grow as quickly.  You can get the purest water we can get.  You can get down to about minus 40 before it freezes.  

This is water from my lab.  For this, technically it's called 18-mega ohm per cm water.  You measure purity of water by its resistance to electricity as it gets purer and purer, and this is really pure water.  I can get this down to about minus 6 before it freezes.  So, this is supercooling and some animals use supercooling to avoid freezing in the Antarctic in the winter.  They get rid of all the ice nucleators, all the particles that ice can grow on.  They throw them out of their body and that drops their freezing point by maybe as much as 5 or 6 degrees and you add anti-freeze to it and they can then go down below minus 20, maybe down to minus 30 before their bodies freeze.  Thank you very much for coming up.

Ginny -   So, what kind of animals use this?

Lloyd -   The best known animals are very small insects, microarthropods - things called springtails and mites and they're the real Antarctic terrestrial animals, the biggest Antarctic terrestrial animal that lives there year-round, is about 2 mm long and it's a mite or a springtail and they use supercooling and anti-freeze to survive down to about minus 35 degrees and they can survive in the crevices during the Antarctic winter, protected a little bit by snow from the minus 50s and 60s above.

Kelvin -   I'm Kelvin from San Francisco.

Chris -   Gosh!  You've come a long way.

Kelvin -   I have and since my name is Kelvin, I think it's very appropriate that I ask this question.  Is there any way for us to do this at home, so for example, by distilling water?

Lloyd -   If you can get your hands on any really pure water, yes, you can.  Your problem is going to be getting it low enough so that it's below freezing and getting it at exactly the right point.  The equipment I brought in here will run at minus 3 degrees all day which means I can set it up and running.  If you put it in your freezer, it's going to go - because your freezer is going to be at minus 18, your timings gonna to have to be good.  But I've done this at home in the freezer and I bought ultrapure water from the chemist and it works.

Chris -   Excellent!  Any more questions?

Kate -   My name Kate Bacher.  I'm also from Godmanchester.  You were talking about anti-freeze.  Is that anti-freeze as we would know it that we put in our cars?

Lloyd -   It's not the same as you would put in your cars, but there are lots and lots of chemicals that are used by animals as anti-freezes.  There's a whole range that are used by fish in the ocean that are proteins and glycoproteins.  Insects have a barrage of anti-freezes, glycerol they can use and they have a whole range that will allow them to survive very, very low temperatures.  They don't use glycol.  Ethylene glycol isn't one that they commonly use, but they got somewhere between 50 and 80 different anti-freeze molecules.  There are a couple of moths that can turn their bodies into 60 or 70% glycerol for the winter time to survive in a kind of semihibernation state over a long period of time and then when the temperatures come back up, they can resynthesize it back into the functioning molecules that they need.

Chris -   Georgia, you've got something.

Georgia -   Mark Shiverett on Twitter wants to know, "Are there any antibiotics or other natural products which come from the sea?"

Lloyd -   There are lots and lots of natural products that come from the sea.  So, there are alginates that are used in ice creams and there are many products, but I don't know about antibiotics.  I suspect there are because I suspect that some of the animals that we have in the sea and some of the bacteria that we have in the sea all interact and lots of them have chemical defences.  Some of those chemical defences will have antibiotic properties.

Georgia -   So, what are these products which go into ice cream?

Lloyd -   Well, alginates for instance...

Chris -   I see which way Georgia' mind works.

Lloyd -   Yeah, there are several low temperature products that are used to keep things slightly plastic in their makeup and they're used to help control the size of crystals when ice grows.  And so, if you control the crystal size very carefully, you can make a smoother ice cream.  And so, those products are used for those sorts of things with ice creams.

Chris -   Ladies and gentlemen, Lloyd Peck from the British Antarctic Survey...
ChatGPT> Sea spiders (Pycnogonida) are a group of marine arthropods found in various oceans, including the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. While most sea spiders are small, some species in the Antarctic have evolved to grow to giant sizes compared to their relatives in other regions. There are several factors that contribute to the large size of Antarctic sea spiders:

Unique ecological niche: Sea spiders in the Antarctic have evolved to occupy a unique ecological niche. They feed primarily on filter-feeding organisms, such as sponges and cnidarians, which are abundant in the cold waters of the Southern Ocean. This food source provides a high-energy diet, allowing sea spiders to grow larger compared to species that feed on smaller prey or have less access to food resources.

Cold water environment: The cold water environment of the Southern Ocean may also contribute to the large size of Antarctic sea spiders. Cold water has higher oxygen content, which can support the larger body size of sea spiders by facilitating oxygen uptake through their thin bodies. Additionally, the low metabolic rate associated with living in cold water environments may allow sea spiders to allocate more energy towards growth and reproduction, resulting in larger body sizes.

Reduced predation pressure: Predation can limit the size of marine organisms. However, the Antarctic ecosystem has relatively low diversity and abundance of large predators compared to other regions, which may result in reduced predation pressure on sea spiders. This lower predation pressure may allow sea spiders to grow larger, as they face fewer constraints from predation-related selection pressures.

Long lifespan and slow growth rates: Sea spiders in the Antarctic have relatively long lifespans and slow growth rates compared to other marine arthropods. This prolonged lifespan and slow growth allow them to accumulate energy and resources over time, resulting in larger body sizes. Additionally, the stable and predictable environmental conditions of the Antarctic, with relatively constant water temperatures and food availability, may also contribute to their slow growth and large size.

Adaptations to cold and harsh environments: Antarctic sea spiders have evolved unique adaptations to cope with the cold and harsh environment of the Southern Ocean. For example, they have specialized appendages that allow them to efficiently capture and handle their prey in cold water conditions. These adaptations may enable them to exploit the available food resources more efficiently, leading to larger body sizes.

In summary, the large size of some sea spider species in the Antarctic can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the availability of a high-energy food source, the unique cold water environment, reduced predation pressure, long lifespan and slow growth rates, and adaptations to cold and harsh environments. These factors collectively contribute to the ecological success and large body sizes of Antarctic sea spiders.

Q. How much plastic is in the ocean?
GT> According to the United Nations global plastic production has gone from 5.5 million Turtle and plastic bagstonnes in the 1950s to 110 million tonnes in 2009.  And because plastics are resistant to the processes that break down materials naturally, they can accumulate in the oceans.

Captain Charles Moore from  Algalita Marine Research Foundation was the first to document what he dubs the 'Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a huge floating mass of plastic aggregated by ocean currents. He told Kat Arney how he found this island. 

Charles - Well, I found it by accident, returning from Honolulu to California. I took a shortcut through an area known as the doldrums or the north pacific high. So repeatedly, for an entire week, small bits of plastic floating by and decided to come back and measure it scientifically and found to my surprise that there were 6 times as much plastic as plankton floating on the surface in this area. So, what you've got is a plastic soup. Now, that soup is bulked out with larger croutons of material and in this last voyage, I actually found a floating island that I walked around and did a kind of a tour. I felt like Captain Cook. I mapped it. I took its position. I named the coves on it. It's quite exciting for a plastic researcher to find a floating plastic island. But basically, what you want to envision when you think of these garbage patches is the equivalent of hundreds of miles of harbour debris attached to each other basically from a couple of hundred miles up the California cost all the way to China in the case of the north pacific, which is my field of expertise.

Kat - So, my question is, where has this all come from?

Charles - It comes from everywhere. We live in the age of plastic. Our lives have plastic in them from dawn until dusk. We're creatures of the plastic age. They deliver our food, we wear them, we make our cars out of them. There's alternatives for every natural material out of plastic and alternatives for every manufacturing material from steel, to aluminium, to glass. All those natural materials that were formally the basic building blocks of industry have now largely been replaced by plastic. New ways of using it and are developed all the time, the problem is, recovery of the material has not kept pace with the creativity of the industry and the inundation of it into the entire world economy. Now, China has embraced the throwaway lifestyle, Indonesia, Malaysia. We just have this material, very light that is able to blow and wash into the sea since the sea is downhill from everywhere and we're not recovering it in any meaningful manner. 

Kat - This sounds like quite a serious problem, but it's in the sea. What harm is it doing? Is this actually damaging the ocean life?

Charles - I have proposed the hypothesis which we're currently testing and I think other scientists should get on-board that more animals are killed right now by plastic in the ocean than by climate change. I think the death toll is alarming. It's in the millions of creatures killed annually by entanglement, by ingestion, by becoming starved by this stuff. Not to mention the fact that all the run off of oils and greases and pesticides sticks to plastic. Plastic is hydrophobic (water fearing) but lipophilic (oil loving) and all of our chemicals are oily and they stick to plastic and then transmit through the food web. And now, we're finding 11,000 cases in the average diet of the shell fish consumer in Europe. We're finding in every gram of oyster meat and every gram of mussel meat in the Gulf of Maine, 15 particles of microplastic. So, it's now part of our food.

Kat - I guess the other question is, this is just one that's off the coast of the Pacific Coast. Are there other aggregations of plastic like this in our other oceans and is this a growing problem for us?

Charles - Yeah. I mean, there's an Around the World Race going on right now and they are becalmed in the Indian Ocean. And so, there's nothing for them to do. And so, reports are coming in of seeing plastic as far as the eye can see from all these Around the World Races that would rather be dashing through the waves but now, they're becalm and they're seeing all these plastic. North and south Pacific, north and south Atlantic and the Indian Ocean all have these gyres, subtropical gyres that act as accumulators for this plastic. We've now sampled all of them and published the paper and found trillions of particles weighing hundreds of thousands of tons. It's a huge amount of plastic out in the ocean.
ChatGPT> The amount of plastic in the ocean is a significant environmental concern, and it has been estimated that there are currently millions of metric tons of plastic in the world's oceans. The exact amount of plastic in the ocean is challenging to measure accurately due to the vastness of the ocean and the fragmented nature of plastic debris. However, scientific studies and estimates based on various data sources provide insights into the scale of the problem. Here are some key findings:

Microplastics: Microplastics are tiny plastic particles measuring less than 5mm in size. They can come from a variety of sources, including broken down larger plastic debris, microbeads from personal care products, and fibers from textiles. Microplastics are widespread in the ocean, and it is estimated that there are trillions of microplastic particles in the ocean, with a total mass estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands of metric tons.

Macroplastics: Macroplastics are larger plastic items, such as bottles, bags, and fishing gear, that are visible to the naked eye. These items can accumulate in marine environments and contribute to plastic pollution. It is estimated that millions of metric tons of macroplastics are currently in the ocean, with concentrations varying in different regions depending on factors such as ocean currents and human population density.

Ghost fishing gear: Ghost fishing gear refers to abandoned, lost, or discarded fishing gear that continues to entangle and capture marine animals. Ghost fishing gear is a significant source of plastic pollution in the ocean, and it is estimated that tens of thousands of metric tons of fishing gear are lost or abandoned in the ocean each year.

Plastic accumulation zones: There are several large areas in the world's oceans, known as "garbage patches," where plastic debris tends to accumulate due to ocean currents and other factors. The most well-known of these is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, located in the North Pacific Ocean, which is estimated to contain millions of metric tons of plastic debris.

It's important to note that plastic pollution in the ocean has widespread environmental impacts, including entanglement and ingestion by marine animals, habitat degradation, and potential impacts on human health. Addressing the issue of plastic pollution in the ocean requires a multi-faceted approach, including reducing plastic waste generation, improving waste management and recycling systems, promoting sustainable practices, and raising awareness about the importance of reducing plastic pollution in our oceans.

Q. With the planet in the middle of its 6th mass extinction event, does de-extinction hold any hope for the species we are losing?
GT> This week, ecologist Danni Green from Anglia Ruskin University, climate scientist James Pope from the British Antarctic Survey, fertility nurse Laura Carter-Penman from Bourn Hall clinic and assistant news editor Tim Revell from New Scientist tackled the questions you've been sending in. First up, Chris spoke to Danni about the problematic plastic in our oceans...

Danni - Yeah. Well I mean it's great because I've been working on plastics the last seven years and thanks to the Attenborough effect we've finally got pretty much global consensus that people are interested in this and they want to solve the problem so it's great.

Chris - How much rubbish actually is in the oceans in terms of plastics?

Danni - A lot. 320 million tons is produced every year and around 10 percent of that makes its way into the rivers and waterways as litter.

Chris -  Goodness and once it’s there it just doesn’t go anywhere?

Danni - It doesn't or it breaks down into smaller pieces.

Chris -  Which we're going to find out about. So Danni is here to answer any questions about marine biology and marine science and plastics in the ocean. Sitting next to Danni is Tim Revell, he is the assistant news editor at New Scientist. So you should be across lots of hot science stories. Lots things coming across your desk all the time.

Tim - Yeah we have loads of big stories all the time. Often talking about artificial intelligence or the latest technologies such as 3D printing. But one of the big ones we've had recently was questioning arguably the biggest discovery in physics in the last few years and that is gravitational waves, whether we actually spotted them or not.

Chris - Why are people skeptical?

Tim -  It all comes down to the fact that it's so difficult to spot gravitational waves because even though they're caused by massive events in space, by the time they get to Earth they're very very tiny ripples. We're talking about measuring something smaller than the size of a proton. So actually being able to find them is really really difficult and involves lots of data processing and analysis and algorithms, and all of that means that it's a bit tricky for someone else to check the work of the people who've done it. And so when people have come in afterwards and had a look at what they've done they've sort of said maybe you have made a mistake and that's where the difficulty lies.

Chris - I think Bill Bryson argued that one of the smallest things in the world is some of the components in an Airfix kit! I think I'd be inclined to agree with him. Anyway Tim's here to answer your questions about things relevant to technology. James Pope is a newcomer to the programme, welcome James. He's from the British Antarctic Survey and you study climate. But why is everyone obsessing about the poles? Because no one lives at the poles really do they? So why is it important to study the poles when the majority of the world's population are not there?

James -The polar regions are just so important for climate change, you've got ice sheets which can affect sea level rise, you've got sea ice which can affect the temperature at high latitudes and maybe accelerate warming in these regions and also very important for uptake of carbon into the oceans, heat into the oceans and even the circulation, which can affect the nice warm temperatures we have in the UK.

Chris - So in other words it really matters what goes on in the poles because it does have an impact here whether we like it or not and I guess it's also a barometer for what's going to happen everywhere. If you look at what happens in the poles it's a reflection on what's happening worldwide?

James - Yes people talk about the poles as being sort of the canary in the coal mine.

Chris - Thank you very much James. And also with us is Laura Carter Penman who is a fertility nurse at Bourn Hall. I guess it doesn't take too much explanation of what  fertility is, but what does a fertility nurse do?

Laura - We assist people through their fertility journey. We advise them on what is the best course of action. What is the best treatment. And we also provide quite a strong counselling role because as you could imagine for patients it's a very stressful time and we support them through that journey. If they've got a question about their fertility that they'd like to ask, I'd be happy to help.
ChatGPT> De-extinction, which refers to the process of resurrecting extinct species using advanced genetic technologies, has been proposed as a potential tool to address the loss of species during the ongoing sixth mass extinction event. However, it is a complex and controversial topic with various ethical, ecological, and practical considerations.

Proponents of de-extinction argue that it could help restore lost biodiversity, repair damaged ecosystems, and provide opportunities for scientific research and education. It could potentially bring back species that have disappeared from the planet, such as the woolly mammoth, the passenger pigeon, or the thylacine, and contribute to conservation efforts by reintroducing them into their former habitats or ecological equivalents. De-extinct species could also serve as flagship species, drawing attention to the importance of biodiversity conservation and raising public awareness about the impacts of human activities on ecosystems and species extinction.

However, there are also numerous concerns and challenges associated with de-extinction. Some of the key considerations include:

Ethical concerns: De-extinction raises ethical questions about the appropriateness of "playing God" and tampering with nature, as well as concerns about the welfare of de-extinct species, their potential impact on existing ecosystems, and the prioritization of resources for de-extinction efforts over conservation measures for existing species.

Ecological considerations: The reintroduction of de-extinct species into their former habitats or ecological equivalents could have ecological consequences, including impacts on ecosystem dynamics, interactions with existing species, and potential for unintended consequences. The ecological roles and interactions of de-extinct species may also not be fully understood, and the potential risks and benefits need to be carefully assessed.

Genetic and technical challenges: De-extinction requires advanced genetic technologies, such as cloning or genetic engineering, which are complex and technically challenging. There are concerns about the quality and stability of the genetic material used in de-extinction efforts, as well as the genetic diversity and adaptability of de-extinct populations.

Resource allocation: De-extinction efforts can be resource-intensive, requiring significant financial, technical, and logistical investments. There are debates about the allocation of limited conservation resources towards de-extinction efforts versus other conservation measures for existing species that are currently threatened with extinction.

Conservation priorities: Some argue that de-extinction efforts may divert attention and resources from more pressing conservation priorities, such as protecting and conserving existing endangered species and their habitats, preventing further extinctions, and addressing the root causes of biodiversity loss, such as habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change.

In conclusion, de-extinction holds both potential promise and significant challenges as a tool for addressing species loss during the current mass extinction event. It is a complex and evolving field of research that requires careful consideration of ethical, ecological, genetic, and practical factors. De-extinction efforts need to be guided by robust scientific research, careful risk assessments, and comprehensive ethical deliberations to ensure that they are carried out responsibly and in alignment with broader conservation goals.

Q. Can elephants cry?
GT> Earlier this week a conservation group published an image of an elephant they had Elephantsrescued. The animal appeared to be crying - some said with relief and joy - prompting the pictures to go viral.

The BBC's Victoria Gill wanted to investigate whether elephants can really cry and she discussed what she'd uncovered with Chris Smith...

Victoria - This is a story that seems to have captured the public imagination all around the world actually this week. A conservation organisation called Wildlife SOS reported that they had rescued an elephant called Raju who had been treated appallingly for apparently 50 years. He'd actually been sort of passed from pillar to post being kept as a begging elephant. He was chained in these horrendous shackles that had spikes on them around his legs that produce very nasty wounds. This was in India. He was in very terrible condition. He was very, very thin and this conservation organisation, the good news story is that they rescued him. But the story that really captured the imagination was this picture of Raju after he was rescued that appeared to show this big streak that looked like a tear running down his face. And so, this conservation organisation and lots of news outlets reported that this elephant had wept with joy. I'm not sure there's any evidence to support that.

Chris - So, you're saying that it is exclusively humans that cry.

Victoria - It seems to be, yeah. I think what we've got here is a case of convenience and probably quite campaigning anthropomorphism. Elephants actually, like a lot of mammals, apart from the mammals that live in water have these lacrimal glands that produce this sort of aqueous - the liquid part of our tears. Our eyes, in order to move around in our sockets and be bathed and protected and protected from bacteria as well have to be constantly bathed in this fluid. And so, lots and lots of these land dwelling mammals produce tears. And actually, elephants are really interesting because they have lots of glands around their eyes that produce different liquids, not just the kind of salty, aqueous tears that we produce. Young males when they're in what's called 'must' which is a kind of high testosterone, very sexually active period, this hormonal response will actually make them produce even more of these secretions. If you go to a safari park, if you go to a zoo, you will see what look like tears streaming down their face, but there's no evidence at all that these are emotional tears, that they're crying like us. That seems to be an exclusively human physiological thing.

Chris - I think there's also some evidence that according to what mood a person is in - human - the composition of their tears changes too. So, there's a difference between emotional tears, sadness, happy tears, and eye-watering because you've got something in your eye type tears.

Victoria - Yeah, there is. I mean, still actually a lot of mystery, kind of evolutionary mystery surrounding why we actually produce tears. I mean, it's something that puzzled even Darwin. There's a really nice book called "Why humans weep." It's a really interesting book and it sort of talks about how our crying actually changes as we mature. Babies and small children are very, very vocal in their crying. As we go to maturity, we will cry very quietly and just produce these tears. What he suggests is that that kind of silent weeping is actually a protective mechanism because if we can show to our social group, our family group around us that we're distressed and we need help, but not call out and make an involuntary sound, that means that the predators won't be able to hear that we're in distress but will be able to give a signal to our group that we need some help.

Chris - Indeed because some people suggest that because so much of our brain - I think a third of, our brain is given over to decoding what we're looking at, we've naturally evolved to have very visual signs of how we're feeling whereas other animals including elephants, they tend to have much better developed senses of other types. And so for them, a physical visible signal like a tear running down their face would be quite literally lost in such a huge area of a face that probably would be less useful to them as a signal.

Victoria - Exactly and with animals whose sense of smell, whose other senses as you say are so much more important to them. Interestingly, we don't seem to be the only animals that will cry as in cry out because if you define crying as an emotional response to distress that might be a vocal response, we've seen that in elephants. We've seen what seems to be collective grieving even. So, there've been observations of elephants gathering around the bodies of deceased elephants in groups. There've been different responses from the different animals in that group and some appear to rock their bodies in response which sounds, anthropomorphising again, like a very human-like distress-like response, that sort of rocking. So, we may well not be the only animals that cry. In fact, we don't seem to be, but we're the only animal that produces these emotional tears, and there's still so much evolutionary mystery around that.

Chris - So, how has it gone down then, your analysis of the fact that the elephant probably wasn't really crying? Has it been well-received or have people shed a tear or two over the fact that elephants don't seem to cry?

Victoria - I think I managed to dampen the nation's spirits by sort of bringing in a little bit of what I thought was quite interesting, sort of actual animal behaviour observation - a bit of ethology, a bit of science into it to just say, "Well, no.  there's no evidence of this" but the physiology of elephants and actually, all the glands around their eyes is really interesting. So certainly, this elephant was producing tears but they weren't emotional tears. I think there was a little bit of not letting science get in the way of a good story there I'm afraid.
ChatGPT> The question of whether elephants cry, in the sense of shedding tears as a form of emotional expression, is a subject of debate among scientists and researchers. While elephants are known to be highly intelligent and social animals with complex emotions, there is limited scientific evidence to support the notion that they cry tears in response to emotional experiences.

Elephants, like most mammals, have tear glands and produce tears for lubricating their eyes and protecting them from dust and debris. Tears also play a role in maintaining eye health. However, tears produced for these purposes are typically not associated with emotional states.

There are anecdotal accounts and observations from elephant caregivers and researchers that suggest elephants may exhibit behaviors that could be interpreted as crying in response to emotional situations, such as vocalizations, trunk gestures, and changes in behavior. For example, elephants have been observed to exhibit distress vocalizations, rumble, and trumpet when separated from their social group, grieving the loss of a fellow elephant, or in stressful situations.

However, it is important to note that animal behavior, including that of elephants, can be complex and multi-faceted, and interpreting behaviors as "crying" in the human sense may be anthropomorphic, which means attributing human emotions or behaviors to animals. Additionally, emotions and tears in animals can be difficult to study scientifically due to the challenges of accurately measuring and interpreting emotional states in non-human animals.

While elephants are known to have strong social bonds, complex behaviors, and emotional experiences, the scientific understanding of whether they cry tears as a form of emotional expression is currently limited, and further research is needed to better understand this aspect of elephant behavior.

Q. How can we keep endangered animals parasite free?
GT> Trying to keep animals safe has a lot of pitfalls. Sometimes threatened animals are moved from one place to another, to keep them safe. And a new study from the University of Cambridge published in Conservation Letters, looking at fresh water mussels, has shown that it can be very easy to transport parasites and other pathogens, along with the animals you’re trying to protect. Josh Brian spoke to Adam Murphy about protecting these mussels...

Josh - Well, they get a whole range of things, and what we've found is that often we don't understand the full range that these mussels get, but some of the main ones are castrating worms. So these worms live inside the gonad of the mussel, castrate the mussel, and then use them basically as a factory to produce their own reproductive stages for the rest of the mussel's life. They also have mites which can eat the gills. And what we're seeing now, especially from the US, is that there's a lot of emerging evidence of viruses and bacteria which can spread through these muscles very, very quickly.

Adam - And why is protecting them so important?

Josh - Well, these freshwater mussels are hugely important in terms of ecosystems, so they were known as "ecosystem engineers''. So they modify the sediment, they help with nutrient cycling, and they're also massive filter feeders. So my favourite stat about freshwater mussels is that the entire volume of the river Cam that flows through Cambridge is filtered through freshwater mussels every two weeks. So they do a massive job of cleaning the water. In addition, because they form these massive mussel beds along the banks, they can help prevent erosion and things like that as well. But on the whole freshwater mussels are actually one of the most threatened animal groups in the whole world. So it's really important that we understand all the threats facing them and take appropriate steps to protect them.

Adam - Say an infected mussel got into an uninfected group, how much damage could that do?

Josh - Well, it could do a whole lot of damage, especially if it's something which can spread straight from mussel to mussel. You know, if the mussels in the recipient population maybe don't have the same immune response that the previous mussel that that was introduced to it does, this could spread very quickly from mussel to mussel, and do a whole lot of damage. However, sometimes it'll also depend on the life history strategy of the parasite. You know, some parasites need multiple hosts in their life cycle. And so if those hosts are present or not, that'll determine how much damage these parasites can do. So we really need to understand not only our mussel populations, but also really need to look more at parasites and their life histories.

Adam - And so I get why this is important for mussels and how important mussels are, but is this work applicable beyond them to other animals?

Josh - Absolutely. So the principles that we talk about in our paper, we think they're relatable to any sort of translocation that we see. What we really want to emphasise in our paper is that, you know, an individual organism isn't actually just one individual, it's a whole community. It's a community of all the bacteria, viruses, worms, ticks, mites, et cetera, that live on it and in it. And if we want to transport organisms appropriately, we really need to appreciate that they do comprise these whole communities, and this will be true for any single animal that's moved. So it's not just mussels that this could be a threat to, any animal could carry parasites or diseases if we move it around and introduce it to new organisms.
ChatGPT> Keeping endangered animals parasite-free can be challenging, but there are several measures that can be taken to help minimize the risk of parasitic infestations and ensure the health and well-being of these vulnerable species. Here are some approaches that can be used:

Preventative measures: Proactive measures to prevent parasites from infecting endangered animals can be highly effective. This includes maintaining clean and hygienic habitats, providing appropriate nutrition and veterinary care, and implementing biosecurity protocols to minimize the introduction of parasites from outside sources.

Regular health monitoring: Regular health monitoring of endangered animals can help detect parasitic infections early and allow for prompt treatment. This can involve routine veterinary examinations, fecal examinations to detect the presence of parasite eggs or larvae, and other diagnostic tests as needed.

Quarantine and isolation: Quarantine and isolation of new animals before they are introduced into a population of endangered animals can help prevent the introduction of parasites. New animals should be thoroughly screened for parasites, and a quarantine period should be established to monitor for any signs of parasitic infestations before they are released or integrated into the main population.

Integrated pest management: Integrated pest management (IPM) approaches can be employed to control parasites in endangered animal populations. This may involve a combination of methods such as biological controls (e.g., using predator species to control parasites), environmental controls (e.g., modifying habitats to reduce parasite populations), and chemical controls (e.g., using anti-parasitic medications under veterinary guidance).

Population management: Managing the population density and structure of endangered animals can also impact the occurrence and spread of parasitic infections. Overcrowding and stress can increase the susceptibility of animals to parasitic infections, so carefully managing population size and structure can help reduce the risk of infestations.

Education and outreach: Educating staff, volunteers, and visitors about the importance of maintaining good hygiene practices, including proper waste disposal, hand washing, and other biosecurity measures, can help prevent the introduction and spread of parasites in endangered animal populations.

Research and innovation: Continued research and innovation in parasitology, veterinary medicine, and conservation biology can lead to the development of new tools, technologies, and approaches for preventing and managing parasitic infections in endangered animals.

It's important to work with qualified veterinary professionals and follow best practices in animal care and management to ensure the health and welfare of endangered animals. Each species and situation may require tailored approaches to parasite control, and conservation efforts should be based on sound scientific principles and ethical considerations to achieve the best outcomes for endangered species conservation.

Q. Can people be gently persuaded to eat less meat?
GT> What factors drive our food choices and dietary decisions, especially when we dine out, or eat at work? Adam Murphy spoke to the University of Cambridge's Emma Garnett, who is trying to change minds in the university's cafeterias, and then to Chris Davis, research director at Impossible Foods, who are trying to make meat substitutes that fully replicate the real thing...

Adam - We know there are benefits to a plant based diet. And we also know that people don't like change, but is there anything that can be done to gently persuade people to be a bit veggie-er? Emma Garnett from the university of Cambridge looked at one approach in the university's cafeterias.

Emma - We found that increasing vegetarian availability in cafes, so instead of one out of four options being vegetarian, it's two out of four, increased vegetarian sales. And not just in people who are more likely to pick a vegetarian option anyway, but even in the most carnivorous diners, they also became more likely to pick a vegetarian option. It seems that just providing people with more vegetarian and plant based alternatives really helps. Another set of studies we did we wondered, how does the position of meals in cafeterias, how does that influence sales? And so week by week, we swapped putting a vegetarian option nearest the entrance, so this veg-first condition, and putting the vegetarian option further away from the entrance and the meat option first. And what we found was that when there was quite a long distance between those two options, 181 centimetres to be precise, then vegetarian sales increased by between four and six percentage points. However, when the vegetarian and meat options were quite close together, less than 80 centimetres, putting the vegetarian option first didn't really increase sales. And in fact, sales could even be lower. So that was quite surprising and unexpected because there's a very commonly held belief - if you want people to just pick something more, you put it nearer a cafeteria entrance. And we found that that's not really the case necessarily. It can work under some circumstances. So it seems to be the more important thing is about having a vegetarian option being the easiest, being the default option, the least effortful.

Adam - But that's not the only way. There have been leaps and bounds made in meat substitutes, things like meat-free burgers or vegan sausage rolls. Chris Davis, research director of Impossible Foods, is working on making the best meatless meat.

Chris - We started off with a specific mission in mind, which was to replace animals in the food system. And in order to do that, you need to provide a better product that provides more consumer benefits and sell it to people at lower cost. Then if that product also has sustainability advantages, you can make some difference to biodiversity et cetera. So because of that, we started off with a very clear focus on meeting the normal meat-eaters where they are today. So not trying to ask them to eat anything different, trying to make something that looks exactly and behaves exactly like the meat they're already eating. And so, as a result of that, we went back to first principles and said, well, what is it about animal tissue that provides the sensory delight? The way it cooks, the way it transitions, the way it handles - all of those things are important to the social glue that meat provides in a lot of ways. And so what we had to do was basically go back to first principles and identify the molecular ingredients that enabled us to replicate that. And I think that's just a very different approach than any of the previous companies that trade in this field. So let's start with the sizzle! The sizzle of cooking meat - if you think about it, it's critical to your enjoyment of meat, but it really has nothing to do with the animal. It's really to do with the way that the fat and the water leaks from the meat when you cook it. And so by measuring that, we can then say, okay, how do we replicate that behaviour? And so we're able to create a fat mimic and include it in the composite material of our meat that had that same performance of leakage that led to the same sizzle. So when you now cook it on the grill, you get the sizzle, you're cooking it on the barbecue, you'll get the flames coming up when the fat hits the coal. It's all driven by our fundamental understanding of how sizzle works. And basically we've done that all the way through meat.

Adam - And what is Chris's admittedly biased opinion about the importance of meat alternatives, like the ones from Impossible Foods?

Chris - This is probably the most interesting and important scientific challenge that is currently going on in the world is how do you feed the world with delicious, nutritious food in a way that enables us to maintain the planet in a state in which we want to live? So we can maintain having rainforests, that we can make a significant dent in climate change. People underestimate how important the food system is to our impact upon the planet. And we can do so much better if we step aside from the stone age technology of animals. Eating animals made sense as a pre-agricultural society, but from just a straight up efficiency perspective and our ability to feed the 9 billion people or so we'll have on the planet in a few years time, we need a better way to feed people.
ChatGPT> Yes, people can be gently persuaded to eat less meat through various approaches that focus on education, awareness, behavior change, and providing alternatives. Here are some strategies that can be used to gently persuade individuals to reduce their meat consumption:

Education and awareness: Providing accurate information about the environmental, health, and ethical impacts of meat consumption can help raise awareness and increase knowledge about the benefits of reducing meat consumption. This can include sharing information about the environmental impact of livestock production, the health benefits of plant-based diets, and the ethical concerns related to animal welfare.

Personal relevance and empathy: Connecting with individuals on a personal level and appealing to their values, emotions, and empathy can be effective in influencing their dietary choices. For example, sharing stories and images of animals, the environment, and communities affected by meat production can evoke emotional responses and encourage individuals to make more sustainable food choices.

Positive messaging: Using positive messaging that focuses on the benefits of reducing meat consumption, such as improved health, environmental sustainability, and animal welfare, can be more effective than negative messaging that focuses on guilt, shame, or deprivation.

Providing alternatives: Offering delicious and nutritious plant-based food options as alternatives to meat can make it easier for individuals to choose meatless meals. This can include promoting plant-based recipes, showcasing plant-based foods in restaurants and food service settings, and providing information on where to find plant-based food products.

Behavioral nudges: Employing behavioral nudges, such as portion control, meal planning, and substitution, can encourage individuals to consume less meat. For example, using smaller plates, offering smaller meat portions, and suggesting meatless days or meatless Mondays can gently guide individuals towards reducing their meat intake.

Role modeling and social norms: Demonstrating positive role modeling and promoting social norms that support reduced meat consumption can be influential. This can involve showcasing individuals or communities that have successfully reduced their meat consumption and highlighting the social, health, and environmental benefits associated with such choices.

Collaborative approaches: Engaging individuals in collaborative approaches, such as community-based initiatives, group challenges, and social campaigns, can foster a sense of belonging, support, and collective action towards reducing meat consumption.

It's important to note that individual dietary choices are influenced by a wide range of factors, including culture, personal preferences, and accessibility to food options. Gentle persuasion approaches should respect individual choices, be inclusive, and avoid judgment or coercion. By adopting a positive, informative, and empowering approach, it is possible to gently persuade individuals to eat less meat and make more sustainable dietary choices.

Q. What are the benefits of eating less meat?
GT> Is a plant based diet better or worse for us than a meat-based one? And, indeed, does it need to be an all or nothing thing: do we actually need to choose, or would a shift towards a more plant-based diet for at least some of our meals be a good compromise? Shireen Kassam is a consultant haematologist with the University of Winchester and she has an interest in the management of chronic diseases using plant-rich diets. Shireen spoke to Chris Smith in the studio, starting with what her own diet choices are...

Shireen - I eat a hundred percent plant-based diet. So other people would call that a vegan diet.

Chris - Okay. I just wanted to put that on the table - excuse the pun - because that way people kind of understand where we're coming from. Now in what ways do you believe that eating a plant-based diet is better for a person than a meat-dominated diet?

Shireen - Well the science is clear on this: the greater your shift towards a plant-based diet, minimising animal foods and processed foods, the healthier you are; and that's healthier bodyweight and significantly reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases, type II diabetes, and certain cancers. And more and more it's clear that those same risk factors are leading to dementia in later life, and if we got away from our conventional meat-based diet there would be less incidence of dementia in our society too.

Chris - So is that the case, then, that if one looks at populations such as in parts of Asia where meat-based diets are rare, that you see a correspondingly low rate of dementia, and a correspondingly low rate of things like diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, and heart attack?

Shireen - Sure, if we look around the world where people are living the longest and the healthiest lives - and these regions in the world are called the Blue Zones - people are eating predominantly plant-based diets, 85-90% plant-based. And when scientific studies have been done looking at difference in the health outcomes for omnivores versus pescatarians, vegetarians, vegans; a stepwise reduction in the amount of animal foods you're eating, the better the health outcomes. So the science is absolutely clear on this.

Chris - But if someone says, well actually I quite like eating meat... and I mean, I'm one of them. You'd have to really twist my arm very hard at my back to dissuade me from occasionally frying up a rasher a bacon; it's just something I really enjoy doing from time to time. Would nevertheless a substitution of some plant-based food stuffs in place of a meat dish still translate into a health benefit? I don't have to go the whole hog... that's probably a bad choice of words isn't it! I don't have to go all the way in order to get some health benefit?

Shireen - No, absolutely. You don't have to be a hundred percent plant-based. But I would like to be clear that you can be perfectly healthy eating a hundred percent plant-based diet. So it comes down to a choice, a choice that we can all make, but any shift towards a plant-based diet is going to be better, as long as it's coming from healthy sources of whole plant foods, fruits, vegetables, whole grains; not the processed plant-based foods that are becoming increasingly available. And if you are going to choose your meat, I really would persuade you not to eat a processed meat like bacon, because it is a Group 1 carcinogen, it causes cancer. So make a better choice.

Chris - Whoops. Okay, well that's that off the menu then. But just coming back to the question of being healthier... because one does hear horror stories where you get people who say, "well, I'm going to turn over a new dietary leaf and I'm going to go down the plant-based diet route, I'm going to eschew meat," and then they wind up in their doctor's surgery with raging anaemia because they're not getting enough iron, and they can also get other micronutrient deficiencies. Is that just poor eating habits because they have embraced the lifestyle without knowing what they're doing, or that is there a high risk that this can happen to anybody?

Shireen - Well I think it can happen to anyone on any diet pattern. And as a haematologist I see plenty of people with iron deficiency, and as you've already pointed out, 94% of the population are not vegan or vegetarian; your risk of anaemia is no greater on a vegan or vegetarian diet. We're doing our current diet pattern very poorly. We're fibre deficient, potassium deficient, folate deficient; and we are eating too much protein from animals and saturated fat. A;l diet patterns need careful planning and we've forgotten how to do that. So if you're shifting a diet pattern, you need to do it with the knowledge and skills to do it properly. As you know, a vegan diet needs supplementation with vitamin B12, because it's not made by humans or animals; but beyond that you need to find your nutrients in the same way as you would on an omnivorous diet.

Chris - And how quickly would one begin to derive benefit? Because if you've been eating a lifetime of meat, is it the fact that if I were to switch to an exclusive plant-based... a) that might upset my system for a while, and b) would it actually be beneficial at a later stage of life to do that?

Shireen - Yeah, it's always beneficial to shift more towards a plant-based diet, but it depends on your starting point. As you pointed out, you can be healthy eating an omnivorous diet if you're doing it with lots of fruits and vegetables and other nutrient-dense foods alongside the meat. So you may not feel anything, but if you did need to improve your health as the majority of the UK population do, you'll find that it's easier to shed a few pounds in the first few weeks because you're eating lower calorie density foods which are more nutrient dense. For example, if you do have prediabetes or type II diabetes, within a few days your blood sugars will come down and you need careful management of that. Within two to four weeks, you'll find that your blood cholesterol level, if it needed to be lower, will come down to a healthier baseline. So yes, within a few days, weeks, months. And of course we're all talking a lot about gut health and the gut microbiome; that only takes a few days of shifting to a healthy plant-based diet to show an increase in the helpful bacteria. But it might be if you're feeling well and healthy, you don't feel any benefits; it's just you're benefiting your long term health, and of course the health of the planet too.
ChatGPT> There are several benefits to eating less meat, both for individuals and for the environment. Here are some key benefits:

Healthier diet: Eating a plant-based diet with less meat can be associated with improved health outcomes. Plant-based diets are typically rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, while being lower in saturated fat, cholesterol, and processed meat. Studies have shown that reducing meat consumption can lower the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, certain types of cancer, and obesity.

Environmental sustainability: Livestock production, particularly industrial-scale meat production, is a major contributor to environmental degradation, including deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, and biodiversity loss. Eating less meat can help reduce the environmental impact associated with livestock production and contribute to more sustainable food systems.

Animal welfare: Many people choose to eat less meat due to ethical concerns about the treatment of animals in industrial-scale livestock production. By reducing meat consumption, individuals can support more humane treatment of animals, including reducing the demand for factory-farmed meat from animals raised in crowded and stressful conditions.

Resource conservation: Meat production requires significant resources, including land, water, and energy. Eating less meat can help reduce the pressure on natural resources, as it takes more resources to produce meat compared to plant-based foods. This can contribute to more efficient resource use and conservation of valuable natural resources.

Climate change mitigation: Livestock production is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, primarily methane and nitrous oxide, which are potent greenhouse gases. By reducing meat consumption, individuals can help lower greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to global efforts to mitigate climate change.

Biodiversity conservation: Land conversion for livestock production, including grazing and feed production, can lead to habitat loss and biodiversity decline. Eating less meat can help reduce the demand for land conversion and contribute to the conservation of biodiversity and natural ecosystems.

Food security: Redirecting resources from livestock production to plant-based food production can help improve global food security. Plant-based diets can be more resource-efficient and have the potential to feed more people with fewer resources compared to meat-heavy diets.

These are some of the key benefits of eating less meat. It's important to note that individual dietary choices are influenced by various factors, and any changes in diet should be done in consultation with a healthcare professional to ensure proper nutrition. Additionally, it's essential to respect individual choices and cultural considerations when discussing dietary preferences and choices.

Q. Why doesn't society go vegetarian?
GT> Surveys suggest about 6% of people in countries like the UK are vegetarian. In the UK, that’s about 3 million people. Looking at it the other way, 94% of the population chooses to eat meat. But why is that? It turns out that it’s probably a behavioural thing that’s programmed into us by our lifestyles from birth, as Adam Murphy’s been finding out, from sociologist Kate Stewart...

Adam - Vegetarianism is on the rise, but even so it's still the minority position. Vegetarians and vegans have plenty of moral arguments, saying things like animals "not being ours to use". And as someone who does eat meat, I find those moral arguments hard to dispute to be honest. But why is meat eating so ingrained in our culture? I spoke to sociologist Kate Stewart from Nottingham Trent University.

Kate - It's something that we do three times a day or more. We eat; we eat together as part of our family units, as part of our friendship units; so changing the normal ways of doing that is actually quite a big task, because it is such a huge part of our everyday lives. I think as vegetarianism, veganism and plant based-diets become more popular, adopted by more and more people, then that process of perhaps shifting becomes a little bit easier, a little less unusual.

Adam - That makes meat eating the default, and the default is easy to maintain. But how are animals presented in society to reinforce that default?

Kate - I think that there's lots of ideas that we have about being special and different and separate from the natural world, if you like; that a way in which we identify ourselves as a species as being important and special is through our sense of dominance, ownership, use of the natural resources on the planet that we live on; this idea that everything else on the planet is there for us to use, and for us to use in order to sustain and enjoy our lives as members of the human species. So from infancy we see messaging about the normality of using animal products, right from the beginning. I mean, if you think about the absurdity of infant milk formula brands referencing cows; the idea that this replacement for human milk is already being subtly messaged as something that comes from another species, and the appropriateness of that. If you look at children's food packaging, mostly canned baby food is rice and vegetables mashed up; you look at the pictures on the front and the description of the meals, it's "Shepherd's Pie", it's "Mum's Roast". It has all of that traditional narrative to it about what a meal is, and favouring the meat part, the animal product part; when in fact if you looked at the ingredient list, that's really not what's in the jar at all! It's mashed up vegetables and rice with maybe a bit of other things for flavouring. So the messaging comes through right from the beginning of life, and then we see it reinforced through how other animals are represented in toys, in games, in film and television, on clothing even. We see this organisation of different species into their appropriate uses to us as humans.

Adam - Some people look down on vegetarians and vegans. There's that old joke: "how do you find the vegan? Don't worry, they'll tell you." But where does that attitude come from?

Kate - I think it's because people see it as being some sort of moral or ethical comment. And it seems to suggest people who aren't vegetarian or vegan feel that vegetarians and vegans are making some kind of suggestion that non-vegans, non-vegetarians, have failed morally; it's some sort of ethical shortfall, that they failed to act on a moral issue, they've failed to do something that vegetarians and vegans have done on an issue of morals. So that prompts all kinds of responses. It can prompt a defensiveness; so you speak to any vegan, they will tell you how common it is for non-vegans to account for their moderate consumption of other animals quite enthusiastically. So that's one common response. But then also quite common is that angry defensiveness turns round as an attack, because it's a response to feeling that their own moral thoroughness is being questioned.
ChatGPT> There are several reasons why society as a whole has not adopted a vegetarian or plant-based diet:

Cultural and societal norms: Eating patterns and food preferences are deeply ingrained in cultural and societal norms. Meat consumption has been a part of human diets for thousands of years, and it is often seen as a traditional or cultural practice in many societies. Changing these norms can be challenging, as people may have emotional, social, and cultural attachments to meat consumption.

Taste preferences: Many people enjoy the taste and texture of meat, and it can be difficult for some to give up meat-based dishes they have grown up with and developed a taste for. Personal taste preferences can be a significant factor in people's food choices.

Convenience and accessibility: Meat and animal-based products are often widely available, affordable, and convenient to purchase and prepare. Vegetarian or plant-based food options may be perceived as less accessible or more expensive, depending on the location and availability of plant-based foods in certain areas.

Nutritional concerns: Some people may have concerns about meeting their nutritional needs on a vegetarian or plant-based diet, particularly in terms of protein, iron, vitamin B12, and other nutrients that are commonly found in animal-based products. While it is possible to meet nutritional needs on a well-planned vegetarian or plant-based diet, some people may have concerns or misconceptions about this aspect.

Emotional and social factors: Food is often associated with emotions, social connections, and traditions. Sharing meals and food-related activities with family, friends, and communities is a common social practice, and some people may feel that giving up meat would mean sacrificing these social connections or traditions.

Lack of awareness: Some people may simply not be aware of the environmental, health, and ethical implications of meat consumption, or may not have access to accurate information about the benefits of a vegetarian or plant-based diet. Education and awareness about the impact of meat consumption on various aspects, including health, environment, and animal welfare, can play a role in changing attitudes and behaviors.

Economic factors: The meat industry is a significant economic sector in many countries, providing employment opportunities and contributing to economic growth. Transitioning to a vegetarian or plant-based diet could potentially have economic implications for the meat industry and related sectors, which may present challenges and resistance to change.

It's important to note that dietary choices are complex and influenced by a variety of factors, and change at a societal level may take time. Efforts to promote plant-based diets can focus on education, awareness, accessibility, affordability, and sustainability, while respecting individual choices, cultural considerations, and addressing potential challenges and barriers.

Q. Why hundreds of elephants died suddenly in Botswana in 2020?
GT> Back in July, we brought you the tragic news of a mass elephant die-off in Botswana’s Okavango Delta: hundreds of the animals were found dead. Originally, the cause was unknown, but, this week, Botswana’s Department of Wildlife and National Parks think they’ve identified the culprit: blue green algae in stagnant water. Phil Sansom spoke to conservationist Vicky Boult, from the University of Reading…

Phil - The first of the elephant deaths were reported back in March. Then from May, the carcasses started appearing in droves.

Newsreader - 169 elephant carcasses were found. By June, that number had risen to over 350.

Phil - Some look like they died incredibly quickly, keeling over onto their knees and faces. Others were reported looking disoriented, walking around in circles before eventually collapsing.

Newsreader - This is deeply troubling. Elephants don't just drop dead for no apparent reason.

Phil - For Africa's largest elephant herd, this unknown devastation looked like an existential disaster. Among all the possible reasons that were suggested, from starvation to dehydration, to deliberate poisoning, Niall McCann from the UK charity National Park Rescue mentioned the following on The Naked Scientists -

Niall - The least likely is that this is a natural toxin. Something like anthrax or a blue-green algae. If it was any of those things, we'd be expecting to see many other species also coming as well.

Phil - Well Botswana's government have just announced that this is indeed the reason.

Vicky - Tests have revealed that it is a cyanobacteria, which is a blue green algae that lives in water bodies.

Phil - [That was] elephant conservationist, Vicky Boult.

Vicky - Cyanobacteria are in many water systems across the world, but they become toxic when they bloom. We call it an algal bloom, which is just a mass generation of new cells, new bacteria. And we see these like blue, green scummy layers on top of water bodies, which is why it's called blue green algae. Usually that water body should be quite warm and nutrient rich and also slow moving or stagnant.

Phil - There's certain types of this blue green algae, this cyanobacteria, that produce neurotoxins. Toxins that hurt your nervous system. Make it start to shut down.

Vicky - You might see symptoms such as confusion, muscle weakness, muscle spasms. And that actually aligns quite closely with some of the symptoms that were reported in these elephants.

Phil - Interestingly, these blue green algae may have actually been the cause of some prehistoric mass elephant die-offs, which would be a bizarre turn of events because there's no record of them happening since. Until possibly now. And why here, in this part of Botswana in the Okavango Delta?

Vicky - The area where these elephants have died is very much enclosed from the broader ecosystem. There are fences separating Namibia from Botswana, but also a veterinary fence, which keeps wildlife and livestock from intermixing. The only other water source that's not a small stagnant pond is the Okavango pan handle. But for elephants to access that they have to move through human settlements and through farmland. So that cleaner water potentially is not readily accessible to them, which may have forced them to use these toxic water bodies.

Phil - No other wildlife species on the planes were affected by this toxic water. And even scavengers like hyenas and vultures that we're seeing feeding on the elephant carcasses showed no signs of illness.

Vicky - There's a couple of possibilities why we're not seeing that. Firstly, it might be that just due to an elephant's sheer size, they drink a huge amount of water and perhaps it's the amount of water and therefore the amount of toxins that they're ingesting. The other option is that elephants and elephant carcasses are very well monitored in Africa. And so it's possible that actually we're recording these dead elephants and not recording anything else because other things are harder to survey or less important to survey.

Phil - Both of these are just theories at the moment.

Vicky - I have seen a lot of people online, still quite skeptical. And I think that's mostly based upon the lack of transparency in the reporting from the Botswanan government. We have very little idea of exactly what samples were taken from the elephant carcasses, but also from the water sources and the broader environment. But we also haven't seen the pure lab results.

Phil - Like we reported last time on the programme when we covered this story, this is bad news for elephants as a whole, because back when researchers just didn't know what this was, there was a worry that this could sweep through the whole of the elephant population, and become their equivalent disaster while coronavirus sweeps through us. If it is the blue green algae, though, then we might hope that this is a limited area, not going to happen now that the temperatures are going down. But if this indeed is something that happened this summer because of warmer temperatures, then who's to say it won't happen next summer or the summer after that?

Vicky - It might be that we've seen the perfect climatic conditions for causing these blooms. Potentially a worry as we're moving into a warming world under climate change, we might start to see some of these algal blooms happening more often.
ChatGPT> In mid-2020, Botswana experienced an unexplained and alarming surge in elephant deaths, with hundreds of elephants dying suddenly within a short period of time. The exact cause of these elephant deaths, which were concentrated in the Okavango Delta region of Botswana, has not been definitively determined, and investigations are ongoing. However, several possible factors have been suggested as potential causes for the mass elephant die-off:

Cyanobacteria bloom: Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, can bloom in stagnant water bodies during warm weather conditions, leading to the production of toxins that can be harmful to animals, including elephants. It has been suggested that a cyanobacteria bloom in water sources in the Okavango Delta may have contaminated the water that elephants drank, resulting in their deaths.

Poisoning: Elephants in Botswana have been known to be targeted by poachers who use poison to kill them for their ivory tusks. It is possible that the mass elephant deaths could have been caused by intentional poisoning using toxic substances.

Disease outbreak: Disease outbreaks, such as viral or bacterial infections, can spread rapidly among wildlife populations, including elephants. An outbreak of a highly virulent disease could have resulted in the mass elephant deaths in Botswana.

Environmental factors: Other environmental factors, such as extreme weather events or changes in habitat or food availability, could have played a role in the mass elephant deaths. For example, severe drought or other climate-related factors could have contributed to the elephants' weakened immune systems, making them more susceptible to disease.

Combination of factors: It is also possible that a combination of factors, such as a cyanobacteria bloom coinciding with other environmental stressors or disease outbreaks, could have contributed to the mass elephant deaths.

Investigations into the cause of the elephant deaths in Botswana are ongoing, and it may take time to determine the exact cause or causes of this tragic event. Understanding the cause of the elephant deaths is important for conservation efforts and for implementing appropriate measures to prevent similar events in the future.

Q. Can we protect transient marine species?
GT> The idea of turning 30% of the high seas into MPAs - that’s marine protected areas - is all well and good, but as we heard from Liberty the exact definition of an MPA is not uniform across the planet. And not only that, but it is also important to recognise just how transient many of our most vulnerable species are. The ocean doesn’t stay still, nor does it respect the legal borders that we put up. So how do we continue to conserve organisms that stray out of these MPAs, and is there anything to prevent the more nefarious fishing regimes from just waiting outside the protected zones, or ignoring them completely? Kirsten Thompson, from Exeter University, spoke about how we might protect our more transient species, and what an ideal MPA might look like.

Kirsten - We would hope that the protection would be a strong level of protection. So more like a marine reserve or a 'no take' zone where you can't necessarily do any fishing or you could not extract oil and gas or create lots of noise pollution. So we would hope that this network would give these areas an ability to recover so that those fish stocks can improve. Where they can be safe havens for breeding animals, say sharks, whales, dolphins. We really want those areas to be reserves so that those populations can increase over time because we've actually exploited the oceans already quite significantly. And those areas need time to recover.

Chris - Are the areas contiguous? Because just listening to what you were saying there, if I were, say, a whale shark that spends some of its life off the coast of Western Australia and then it migrates and takes a massive journey almost all the way around the globe going from A to B, if it doesn't remain continuously in a marine protected area, then it's vulnerable when it's not.

Kirsten - So we are really looking at a network of protected areas. So they need to be large enough to support the species that are within these particular areas, but also they need to be connected and well connected so that those migratory species can pass right across the oceans and will have some level of protection throughout their migrations. And that's really important for many of these species that undergo these really long and large scale migrations right across ocean basins.

Chris - I'm minded of research, which it's almost smacks, one Australian researcher put it to me, research into the blinking obvious. But when one looks at the graph of how much land area is apportioned to, say, pandas in China, people are saying, 'look, they've got lots of space to live in, so why are there numbers in decline?' And it took somebody else to then say, 'well let's look at how well connected those bits of land are.' In fact, they're tiny morsels of land with human encroachment separating them all. So the amount of free roaming those animals can do is relatively minimal. And are we not in danger of it looking good from far this 30% of the world's oceans is a good starting point, but if they're not in the right places and joined up in the right way, they're not going to deliver?

Kirsten - Yeah, exactly. It needs to be effective protection and for it to be effective, they need to be well connected and there needs to be a high level of protection within these areas. And of course they need to be designed so that they're in the right place. And so it might take a bit of time and monitoring to see whether when we first put these areas together and draw these lines on the map, we might need to monitor their efficacy over time to make sure that we've got it right.

Chris - Who's going to do that, do you think? And will this come down to individual countries or will there be some kind of overarching organization that will have some kind of ability to give sanction or some teeth if you like, to make sure that this is done appropriately and consistently? Because one of the other things we've seen with other initiatives, especially environmental and conservation initiatives, is if the power's in the wrong hands and there's no way to predate miscreants, then standard slip.

Kirsten - Yeah. And I think that's gonna be key moving forward. And I think those are all the details that I think we'll see being formalized over the next 10 to 20 years. Really, how is this going to work and who's going to enforce these protections? Because these are areas that are quite inaccessible and far out to sea. So that's the detail we really need to get to grips with.

Chris - When scientists are sitting down to say, 'these are the crucial targets we must go for first,' what's at the top of our pecking order?

Kirsten - I don't think that we know enough about the oceans and I think it's difficult to know what species or habitats you would try and protect up the hierarchy, which ones are worth more than the other. I don't think we can really ask that question because to be honest. For a good functioning ecosystem, we need as many as these areas protected as possible. And all at once, we need this to be done quite urgently. So I don't think we could really have some sort of hierarchy or idea of what's most important because to be honest. It's all important.

Chris - You can never do an interview like this without considering the impact of climate change, which is all too obvious in terms of its manifestations around the planet. Has that been taken into account in terms of what we want to protect? Because it's clear that some areas are gonna change dramatically in the next five decades and we may end up conserving what becomes a desert and that's of value to nobody. So are people trying to sort of future proof this by anticipating where climate change is likely to put places under pressure, but may create the next wonderful place to conserve, which isn't at the moment because that's where the animals go when their current home becomes inhospitable.

Kirsten - We are really looking at more of the sort of dynamic approach to protection. So that's going to involve thinking ahead, being responsive to the data that we get back from monitoring and actually making changes in the future if we know that those species need to be protected, be protected in those areas. So it's much more of a dynamic global approach and that's why a network of marine protected areas is gonna be much more valuable to us for protection than just this idea of the static individual MPAs that aren't connected to other places.
ChatGPT> Yes, transient marine species, such as whales, dolphins, and other marine mammals, can be protected through various conservation measures. These species are an important part of marine ecosystems and play vital roles in maintaining healthy ocean ecosystems. Here are some ways in which transient marine species can be protected:

Conservation laws and regulations: Governments can enact laws and regulations to protect transient marine species. These may include measures such as protected areas, fishing restrictions, hunting bans, and regulations on human activities that may harm or disturb marine mammals.

International agreements: International agreements, such as the International Whaling Commission (IWC), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), among others, provide a framework for international cooperation in the conservation of marine species, including transient marine mammals.

Monitoring and research: Monitoring and research efforts can provide valuable information about the distribution, abundance, behavior, and threats to transient marine species. This information can inform conservation efforts and help identify key areas for protection, as well as provide data for management decisions.

Conservation partnerships and collaborations: Collaborative efforts among governments, conservation organizations, researchers, and local communities can lead to effective conservation initiatives for transient marine species. These partnerships can help raise awareness, implement conservation measures, and support local communities in protecting these species.

Sustainable fisheries and bycatch reduction: Sustainable fishing practices, including reducing bycatch (accidental capture of marine mammals in fishing gear), can help protect transient marine species that may be affected by fishing activities.

Education and outreach: Educating and raising awareness among local communities, stakeholders, and the public about the importance of transient marine species and their conservation can help build support for conservation efforts and promote responsible human behavior toward these species.

Addressing climate change: Climate change poses significant threats to marine ecosystems and marine species, including transient marine mammals. Addressing climate change through mitigation and adaptation measures, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting critical habitats, and promoting ecosystem resilience, can help protect transient marine species in the long term.

It's important to note that protecting transient marine species requires sustained efforts at local, regional, national, and international levels, as well as the involvement of various stakeholders, including governments, communities, scientists, conservation organizations, and the public.

Q. Could seagrass hold the key to cleaning up our oceans?
GT> For years we’ve abused the oceans and used them as dumping grounds for everything from plastics and chemicals to industrial waste and even raw sewage. This is having a devastating effect in some areas by causing bacteria to thrive, which is killing off fish and corals and also increasing the odds of humans becoming unwell. Now scientists have discovered that the sea may have its own solution in the shape of seagrasses, which come with their own inbuilt water cleansing system. Drew Harvell, from Cornell University spoke to Chris Smith about these mysterious plants...

Drew - Seagrasses are flowering plants so just like our grasses on land they have little flowers and they produce seeds which are then sexually produced and start new plants. They also can clonally produce so vast meadows can spread really quite quickly. Seagrass beds are the base of the food chain in the ocean. They provide critical nursery areas for baby fishes, and forage fishes which are big fishes like salmon and even killer whales eat. They also do a lot of filtering of coastal pollution and even absorb carbon dioxide. So seagrass meadows are considered a source of what we call blue carbon in a sense they can absorb a lot of carbon dioxide and potentially mitigate ocean warming impacts.

Chris - What have you been asking in this present study about seagrasses?

Drew - In this study we wanted to focus on the filtration services of seagrass and their capability to reduce bacteria in the water in areas where there was very high sewage pollution. We worked on these four islands in Indonesia that were very large sources of sewage pollution and we examined how the levels of bacteria changed as the water passed over the seagrass beds. This was done by my post-doc, Joleah Lamb, in collaboration with Indonesian scientists that we’d been working with and they both studied particular species of bacteria which is the one that we in the United States use for testing the quality of our waters (the enterococcus). And then when they found a large impact of the Enterococcus, they went and completely sequenced all of the bacteria in the water and showed large reductions in multiple pathogens that could affect humans as well as fishes and invertebrates.

Chris - So, in a nutshell, where you see seagrass you see fewer nasty bacteria?

Drew - Exactly. There’s a big difference in the levels of bacteria that have passed over the seagrasses. So we think of them as a possible mitigation for sewage pollution or a way to make the water cleaner and healthier.

Chris - How much of a difference was there in terms of the bacterial burden in the water when you compare areas that have got a lot of seagrass with those that haven’t?

Drew - At some of these sites there were levels of potentially pathogenic marine bacteria that impact human, fishes, and invertebrates that were reduced by 50 percent when the seagrass meadows were present compared to sites without seagrass meadows.

Chris - How do you think the seagrass is doing that then?

Drew - that’s really one of the exciting frontiers for our future work. We’re very excited to work out what are called the mechanisms by which seagrass are removing bacteria. One possibility is that a lot of the animals that live in the seagrass, such as the clams, the bivalves, the sponges are filter feeders and they’re directly sucking up bacteria for themselves. But we also think that the seagrasses can detoxify or remove the bacteria. For example, seagrasses produce oxygen and a lot of these bacteria can’t live with oxygen and so that’s an important mechanism of detoxification. And then finally, there are the microbiome of the seagrass, the bacteria that live on the surface of the seagrass, can also kill the bacteria. So there are a range of these different mechanisms that we’re investigating.

Chris - Do you think then, that it might be worth probing seagrass to see how they’re doing this and whether there might be some potential untapped resources in there that we could use for making human’s healthier? We know that we’re facing an antibiotic apocalypse where there are just not drugs for some of these infections any more. Do you think seagrass might have lurking in it a solution?

Drew - Oh that’s such a great question. There’s so much potential for innovation in the way that we deal with our pathogen bacteria in our society and, of course, we should be looking to natural sources like the oceans and seagrasses. So yes, for example, there’s a bacterium that lives on seagrasses that kills harmful algal blooms so likely there are some bacteria that live on seagrasses that could also kill other bacteria. So that’s a very exciting frontier for discovery.
ChatGPT> Seagrass meadows, which are marine flowering plants that grow in shallow coastal waters, have been recognized as important ecosystems that can play a role in cleaning up our oceans. Seagrass meadows can potentially act as "blue carbon" sinks, capturing and storing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through their photosynthetic processes, and thus helping to mitigate climate change. Additionally, seagrass meadows can provide a range of other ecosystem services, including improving water quality, providing habitat for marine species, and stabilizing sediments, which can help reduce coastal erosion.

Here are some ways in which seagrass meadows could potentially contribute to cleaning up our oceans:

Carbon sequestration: Seagrass meadows have been found to be highly effective at capturing and storing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through their biomass and sediments. This makes them an important natural carbon sink, helping to mitigate climate change by reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Nutrient uptake and water quality improvement: Seagrass meadows can act as filters, taking up nutrients from the water column, including nitrogen and phosphorus, which are often associated with pollution from agricultural runoff and sewage discharge. This can help improve water quality and reduce nutrient pollution in coastal waters, which is beneficial for marine ecosystems and can contribute to cleaning up our oceans.

Habitat provision: Seagrass meadows provide important habitat for a wide range of marine species, including fish, invertebrates, and juvenile sea turtles. By providing refuge and food sources, seagrass meadows support biodiversity and contribute to the health of marine ecosystems.

Sediment stabilization and erosion control: Seagrass meadows help stabilize sediments with their extensive root systems, which can reduce coastal erosion and protect shorelines from wave action and storm surges. This can help protect coastal ecosystems and infrastructure from erosion and contribute to the overall health of coastal areas.

Restoration potential: Seagrass meadows have the potential to be restored in areas where they have been lost due to human activities, such as coastal development, pollution, and habitat destruction. Seagrass restoration efforts can help bring back these valuable ecosystems and their associated benefits, contributing to ocean cleanup efforts.

While seagrass meadows have the potential to contribute to cleaning up our oceans, it's important to note that they are also facing threats from human activities, such as coastal development, pollution, and climate change. Conservation efforts, including protection of existing seagrass meadows, restoration of degraded seagrass areas, and sustainable management of coastal areas, are necessary to ensure the health and resilience of seagrass ecosystems and their potential for contributing to ocean cleanup efforts.

Q. There have been a number of mass-extinctions previously on Earth. Is another one on the cards? And if so, could humans be the next victims?
GT> Humans often get the blame for wiping out species, and indeed our track record isn't good, but species have been going extinct on en masse for millions of years - long before we were around. We've been hearing about mass-extinctions, including the Permian mass-extinction, the biggest extinction of all time when life nearly died out entirely, 250 million years ago. What role might humans be playing in making history repeat itself?earth

Bristol University palaeontologist Mike Benton joins Chris Smith...

Chris -   First of all, can we just look at one aspect which is an intriguing component of these die-offs which is that every time we've had a mass extinction, the answer is that nearly all life disappears, but not all life.  There's always something left and what is it about the life that's left that means it doesn't disappear?

Mike -   Well of course, after an extinction event, the survivors, as Pauls said, may be in some cases especially adapted to living in conditions of poor oxygen or high temperatures.  In other cases, they're just lucky.  And then it depends on what the physical conditions on the Earth are in the time after the extinction event.  Often, people have assumed that you have the stress, the impact of the meteorite which are dead dinosaurs or the massive volcanic eruptions and all of the consequences of that.  And then the Earth kind of settles down rather quickly. 

Well, we now know is in some cases, at least after this big and permanent mass extinction that Paul was talking about, the Earth did not settle down.  For five million years, there were a number of repeated and rather similar crisis.  So, as life picked up and got going again, certain groups started to speciate.  Wham!  They were hit again and set back.  So, it took about 10 million years in that case.

Chris -   It really was survival of the fittest.  What would've been the transition or the sorts of life that emerged as successes to what was wiped out during that Permian mass extinct?

Mike -   In the early part, there were what we call sometimes disaster species.  These are the one that can take  advantage of the rather stressful conditions in the immediate aftermath as Paul was saying.  Species that can survive in conditions of high temperature or low oxygen.  But then as the Earth settled down and returned to equilibrium in some way then you get the founders of the major new groups.  And so now, we can look back at the terrible extinction 252 million years ago and think, "Well, it actually punctuated the history of life and reset evolution by wiping out all of the previously dominant groups.  So, we can be glad.  We're here, the dinosaurs came after that, various other groups were highly successful.  But it did take a long time to recover.

Chris -   I was going to say, is it actually this that helped to lay the groundwork for us coming along because I know that obviously, mammals didn't really begin to dominate until after the dinosaurs had exited, but they had to come from somewhere?  Where the grounds were all sort of set out then with this mass extinction, enabling mammals to begin to appear?

Mike -   It seems that may be the case because as Paul said, there were a whole lot of different reptiles and so on at the end of the Permian which were quite sprawling awkward pictures not very fast moving.  After they had been wiped out, there was quite a change in pace in the following period of time called the Triassic.  And the ancestors of mammals and indeed the ancestors of dinosaurs and various other groups got going.  They were no longer sprawling animals with the arms and legs out to the side.  They kind of stood upright as mammals do, birds do, and could move faster and adapt to other things ultimately including flights and various other modes of life.

Chris -   So, we effectively selected  for animals that were much fitter, reproductively fitter, they were more adaptable, and if it hadn't been for these mass extinction events then we wouldn't have species that are so resilient today perhaps?

Mike -   That might be.  I think certainly, there were stresses there.  It would be very wrong to think that there was kind of inevitability or a kind of enhancement in a sort of mystical way.  But in terms of evolution and the pace on land at least seem to hot up.  And maybe in the sea because I think there were major steps in evolution of life in the sea, faster moving fishes which were the ancestors of the modern fishes that are very familiar to us in the oceans, like cod.  All those types that they track back to then and they were  preyed upon by giant marine reptiles which David Norman mentioned earlier. 

Chris -   One thing that's always baffled me is if you look at a crocodile that you've got there something which pretty much is reminiscent of what dinosaurs would've been sort of like, haven't you?  They survived because the ancestors of crocodiles go back hundreds of millions of years.  They weren't wiped out.  So, why did they persist but these other stressors that did for the dinosaurs and things that came before them, why did crocodiles make it?

Mike -   Very hard to say in any particular case because you know, whatever I say is untestable, so one has to be careful.  Crocodiles and their ancestors have always been probably relatively low metabolic rate creatures - cold blooded we would say.  There aren't very many species of them today.  They were much more successful during the age of the dinosaurs.  There were even bipedal, two-legged crocodiles that were even plant-eating crocodiles.  So, they were more adaptable then it seems than they are today. 

Whether it was something to do with that low metabolic rate because we know pretty well that dinosaurs in one way or another were warm blooded - a bit like birds, a bit like mammals today.  Whether that meant that they larger food supplies, that's certainly something you would expect.  Many of the dinosaurs of course were positively huge and being huge is not a great thing when the Earth is undergoing stress.

Chris -   Because of course, getting rid of that heat becomes a problem doesn't it?  Lastly Mike, can you just tell us whether or not we might see history repeating itself.  Do you think that there are other things coming now that means that it was the dinosaur 60 million years ago.  Next is humans?

Mike -   I don't think we can specifically say that because the earth has changed.  And so, responses to different kinds of environmental stress is maybe different.  But there's no question as we heard earlier that humans are now driving an extinction at quite a fast rate and maybe a hundred times the rate that it ought to be because extinction is normal as I think you said.  Before, species don't exist forever.  But currently, the rate of extinction is at least 100 times what it ought to be.

Chris -   Ouch!  Well have to watch our behaviour, weren't we?  Thank you very much.  That's Mike Benton from Bristol
ChatGPT> Mass extinctions are events in Earth's history when a significant proportion of species go extinct within a relatively short period of time. There have been several mass extinctions in the past, with the most well-known being the extinction of the dinosaurs (Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction) around 66 million years ago. These mass extinctions were driven by various factors, such as large asteroid impacts, volcanic activity, and changes in climate and sea level.

Currently, the planet is facing a biodiversity crisis, with many species facing extinction due to human activities such as habitat destruction, pollution, climate change, over-exploitation, and invasive species. This has led to concerns about the potential for another mass extinction event, often referred to as the "sixth mass extinction" or the "Anthropocene extinction," with humans as potential victims. The rate of species extinction today is estimated to be much higher than the natural background extinction rate, and many scientists believe that we are currently undergoing a mass extinction event caused by human activities.

The potential consequences of a mass extinction event, including the extinction of humans as a species, are complex and uncertain. However, it is clear that the loss of biodiversity can have significant impacts on ecosystems, including changes in ecosystem functioning, reduced resilience to environmental changes, and disruptions to ecosystem services that are essential for human well-being, such as food production, water purification, and climate regulation.

Humanity is not immune to the consequences of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. As a species, humans depend on healthy ecosystems for our survival and well-being, including access to food, water, shelter, and other resources. Loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services can directly and indirectly impact human societies, economies, and health. For example, disruptions in food production due to loss of pollinators, declines in fish stocks due to overfishing or habitat destruction, and increased vulnerability to extreme weather events due to loss of coastal ecosystems can all have negative impacts on human populations.

Therefore, it is important for humans to recognize the value of biodiversity and the essential role that healthy ecosystems play in supporting our own well-being. Conservation and sustainable management of ecosystems, biodiversity, and natural resources are critical for reducing the risk of a mass extinction event and ensuring the long-term survival and well-being of both human and non-human species on Earth. Taking action to address the root causes of biodiversity loss and mitigate human impacts on ecosystems is essential to prevent further degradation of our planet's biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Q. 250 million years ago, life on Earth looked very different, both in the sea and on land. What wiped these strange creatures away?
GT> An asteroid was at least partly to blame for the dinosaurs' demise, but are giant rocks from space the only things that have threatened to wipe life off the face of the Earth? Before the dinosaurs ever existed, there was a time when the planet was teeming with strange creatures in both the sea and on land, until disaster struck and all life nearly died.Permian life at Sea

Paul Wignall from University of Leeds here with us live to tell us about the biggest mass-extinction in the history of life on Earth...

Ginny -   So, an asteroid was at least partly to blame for the dinosaur's demise, but are giant rocks from space the only things that have threatened to wipe life off the face of the Earth?  Before the dinosaurs even existed, there was a time when the planet was teaming with strange creatures in both the sea and on land until disaster struck and nearly, all of life died.  Paul Wignall from the University of Leeds joins us to tell us about the biggest mass extinction in the history of life on Earth.  So Paul, how big are we talking here?

Paul -   The biggest of all time as you said.  So, we're looking in full time when there was about 90% of all species, animals and plants disappeared.

Ginny -   That's a huge proportion but do we have any idea of exactly how many creatures that would be?

Paul -   It's difficult to say, but we're probably of the order of millions and numbers of species would be millions as well.

Ginny -   When exactly did this happen?

Paul -   I had what we call the end of the Permian period and that's 252 million years ago.  So, a long time ago.

Ginny -   That's quite early in the sort of history of life.  I imagine, the world would've looked very different back then.  What kind of creatures were there around?

Paul -   Yes, it was indeed a long time ago.  The animals on land would look rather sort primitive to us today.  So, rather sort of lumbering, sort of creatures, sort of premature reptiles and a group known as the therapsids which have gone on to give rise to the mammals.  But back in those days, there were rather sort of sprawling sort of posture.

Ginny -   What about plants?  Would the plants have been very different?

Paul -   Not quite as different.  There were no sort of familiar flowering plants that we now, but then there were conifers, fur trees, and ferns and things like that were present then.

Ginny -   And in the sea, were things similar, where there are weird creatures there as well?

Paul -   Again in the sea, there are some groups which have now long gone like the trilobites which were familiar with fossils but they are no longer with us.  Although groups like fish and molluscs and things like the brachiopods which are a group of little shell fish and so on, they were present and common in the sea then.  So, some of them, we still have with us and others disappeared.  Some of them disappear at this mass extinction.

Ginny -   And trilobites, those ones that look like kind of giant wood lice aren't they?

Paul -   That's right, yeah, like little sea wood lice.

Ginny -   So, it would've looked quite different in some ways, but quite similar in others?

Paul -   That's right.  Some of the modern looking fish weren't around at that time and there are clams as well, modern clams hadn't arisen.  But in other ways, it wouldn't be as quite as strange as life on land would've looked.

Ginny -   So, what happened to all these amazing creatures?  Why did they die out?

Paul -   They died out, we think, because of this huge volcanic area in Siberia which we know erupted at exactly the time of the extinction.  So, that looks like the culprit if you like, the large smoking gun for this catastrophe.

Ginny -   And how do you know that, firstly, that that happened and secondly, that that was what wiped out life?

Paul -   We know what's left of this province.  At that time, there were millions of cubic metres of lava erupted and it's a timing really as in a lot of things started in the past.  We know from dating, it was exactly the time of the extinction.

Ginny -   How do you go about dating things?

Paul -   You can do it sort of directly because - if you go to Siberia and you look at these lavas, they had layers of sediment in-between the lavas and you can collect fossils from those layers of sediment.  And so, you can look at the lavas and fossils, and look at the timing of everything.  And you can give a natural sort precise age of the lavas by dating which a geologist use a technique called geochronology.  It's where you use radioactive elements and the rate at which they decay tell you how old rocks are.

Ginny -   Now, I can see how a volcano erupting in Siberia would kill off a lot of animals in Siberia, but how did that affect the rest of the world?

Paul -   The actual lava was only dangerous in Siberia, but the main problem with large scale volcanism and a lot of giant eruptions and other gases that come out.  The gas is actually rather familiar to us today as well as carbon dioxide which is a greenhouse gas of course.  And then we have all the gases like sulphur dioxide and some acetic halogen gases as well which will come out in huge amounts from giant scale volcanic eruptions like this.

Ginny -   Would those gases have been directly poisoning animals?

Paul -   Not directly.  The carbon dioxide, its main effect is to cause warming and we know that things were extremely warm at the time of this extinction.  For the other gases, we think, actually one of the main effects of some of these other gases is that they do damage to our ozone shield.  As a result of that, it allows a lot of UV radiation to sort of bathe the planet which is obviously not good.

Ginny -   So, what is it that would actually be killing off the animals?

Paul -   Well, UV radiation would cause the effects of cancer if you like, but the cell damage, it causes plants to die and the animal that eat plants will therefore struggle.  In the oceans, it's actually a little different.  I think it's the warming effects of oceans that's really harmful thing.  That causes increases in temperature but you also start to lose the oxygen content of the oceans as well.  So, it's sort of this warm, lack of oxygen is bad in the oceans.

Ginny -   How warm are we actually talking?  How big a difference from before the volcano to after it?

Paul -   It's huge.  It's one of the biggest warming events we've yet discovered.  Temperature is rising about 15, approaching 20 degrees C.  Certainly, for the ocean surface water approaching temperatures of the high 30s - 30 degrees, 37 degrees, that sort of temperature which is the sort of temperature that you take a shower at, but this is sort of year round and because it's pretty, pretty harsh.

Ginny -   That's a huge difference. How quickly did that happen?

Paul -   It's a good question.  We say between tens to hundreds of thousands of years.  So, as a geologist, I think that's quick but obviously, not on a human scale, it's relatively slow.

Ginny -   But too fast for most animals to evolve to survive it?

Paul -   That's right.  Once you start getting temperatures above sort of 35 degrees C, a lot of things can't survive at those temperatures.  You just run into all sorts of problems.  Photosynthesis for most plants is very difficult to that temperature as well.  So, you start to run out of plant matter and stuff, run out of things to eat.

Ginny -   But there were a few things that survived.  What made them special?

Paul -   Yes, there's a few survivors fortunately so they carry on populating the planet.  In the oceans, I think we looked at groups particularly some molluscs groups, are good at tolerating low oxygen and high temperature and they do quite well at that time.  They do survive the extinction.  On land, I think it's an interesting selection of animals that survive including a group which give rise to mammals later on.  I think for some of those animal groups on land, I think the ability to adapt would've been good.  That's sort of the hot temperature equivalent of hibernating.  So, when it gets really hot then it's a good idea to just sort of sleep it out for several months and just wake up when things get a little bit better for short periods of time.

Ginny -   So, was this all just chance that these volcanoes erupted?  Could it happen again?

Paul -   It could happen again.  There's been events like this as well.  This is just the worse one of its kind.  I think we'll know if it happens because the magma rises up from deep within the Earth.  In effect, geophysicists and people who study the structure of the Earth would see it coming.

Ginny -   But even if we could see it coming, would there be anything we could do?

Paul -   No.

Ginny -   Fairly worrying, but I guess we just have to keep our fingers crossed that it doesn't happen again in our lifetimes at least.

Paul -   I think so, yes.

Ginny -   Thanks so much for your time.  that was Paul Wignall from the University of Leeds.
ChatGPT> The event you are referring to is known as the Permian-Triassic extinction, or the "Great Dying," which occurred around 252 million years ago. It was the most severe mass extinction event in Earth's history, resulting in the extinction of approximately 96% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species.

The exact cause of the Permian-Triassic extinction is still debated among scientists, and likely resulted from a combination of multiple factors. Some of the leading theories and hypotheses include:

Large-scale volcanic activity: It is believed that extensive volcanic eruptions occurred during the late Permian period, releasing massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to global warming and ocean acidification. This may have caused widespread habitat destruction, including loss of shallow marine environments where many species lived.

Climate change: The release of greenhouse gases from volcanic activity could have caused rapid climate change, leading to changes in sea level, ocean currents, and temperature gradients, which could have disrupted marine ecosystems and caused widespread extinctions.

Anoxia: The volcanic activity could have also triggered widespread anoxia, or lack of oxygen, in the oceans. Anoxic conditions would have led to the death of many marine species that rely on oxygen, such as fish and other marine animals.

Impact event: There is also evidence of a large asteroid or comet impact around the time of the Permian-Triassic extinction, which could have caused widespread destruction and disruption to ecosystems.

Oceanic regression: Changes in sea level and oceanic regression, caused by tectonic movements and changes in climate, could have led to habitat loss and changes in marine ecosystems, contributing to the extinction of many species.

It is likely that a combination of these factors, including volcanic activity, climate change, anoxia, impact events, and changes in sea level and oceanic regression, contributed to the severity of the Permian-Triassic extinction event. The exact sequence and timing of these events are still the subject of ongoing research and scientific investigation.

Q. 65 million years ago, dinosaurs ruled the Earth, until suddenly they all vanished off the planet forever. What killed the dinosaurs?
GT> Modern humans have only been around for a relatively short time - just 60,000 years or so, and mass extinctions have been happening for much longer. So what else wipes out species, and how do scientists do a palaeontological post mortem to find out what happened?fabulous dinosaur

Sara Sjosten went behind the scenes at the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences in Cambridge to meet dinosaur specialist Dave Norman. He explained what fossils can tell us about mass extinctions, and why the dinosaurs disappeared abruptly about 60 million years ago...

Dave -  Finding fossils like this remarkable jaw here, this is just a fragment of a jaw and it's 20 cm long with sort of 7 or 8 cm long teeth which are huge and spiked.  I know that's a lizard because I'm enough of an anatomist to be able to recognise the characteristics of the bone, the shapes of the teeth.  This is an animal that lived a long time ago, towards the end of the Cretaceous period and I can say that it was lizard-like but it had flippers instead of conventional legs and it swam through the sea and was a giant predator.  This isn't the world of the present day.  This is a very different world.  Studying fossils allows you to look at the way in which the world has changed, and how different the world was in the past.  Now rather curiously, the animals that you find in rocks of Cretaceous, that's 65 million years ago, that particular population of types of animals which included these giant lizard-like creatures, which are known as mosasaurs, and a whole variety of dinosaurs, very, very suddenly disappeared.  If you look at rocks that are younger than 65.5 million years of age, look as you might for these gigantic and dramatic looking creatures, you can't find any.  Within 10 or so million years, you start to get rather different looking creatures, utterly unlike the ones that lived in that previous world.  Life had changed, something very dramatic had happened that in a sense wiped away the mosasaurs, the dinosaurs and indeed, a whole variety of other sorts of organisms and in a sense, made a space.  It's like a punctuation in the history of life.

Sara -  The world changed dramatically from a time of giant reptiles like the mosasaur with the jaw the size of my arm to the world we know, where mammals and birds cover the land.  What happened?  Was it down to some cataclysmic event?

Dave -  What we've got is in a sense, a whole range of different lines of evidence that are all pointing towards something very dramatic happening about 65.5 million years ago.  There were various hints from the fossils that animals disappeared rather dramatically at 65 million years ago and were replaced by different types of animals and plants.  Therefore, there's a lot of focus on rocks of exactly that sort of age and whether they have any particular chemical or geological characteristics.  One of the things that started to be discovered was that the rocks at that time zone tended to have what are called tectites, lots of little glass beads, which could've been the result of an explosive event rather like a huge explosive volcano.  Obviously, the nearer to this event, the more of these glassy beads you would find and the further away, the fewer you would find.  The focus of attention gradually became southern North America and northern South America, and then some astrophysicists came along.

Sara -  Louis Alvarez was an astrophysicist at this time.  He was brought into this problem when his son asked him to date a strange layer of clay from Panama.  Often, rocks can be dated using radioactive elements.  These decay at steady rate, so by measuring their relative abundances in the minerals in a rock, it's possible to work out the age of the rock.  But this clay didn't have any minerals to date, so Alvarez suggested they look at the other elements in the clay.  He found that there was an unusually large amount of the trace metal iridium.  Iridium rains down on the Earth's surface at a constant rate.  So, any extra iridium could only come from one place - space.  Geologists now had an idea of what to look for and the glass bead distribution told them where to look.  They took large boats off the coast of Central America, equipped with something like sonar for imaging the subsurface in what's called seismic profiling.  There, they found the key evidence and solved the mystery of the disappearing dinosaurs.

Dave -  Finally, seismic profiling allowed us to identify a ring structure in the Yucatan Peninsula.  That ring structure seemed to reflect the fact that there was actually a very large meteorite impact that left this huge crater under the ground.  And that everything was now beginning to fall into place.  We had this extraordinary coming together of evidence from an astrophysicist, evidence from the fossil record, evidence from the chemistry, the nature of the geological sediments of the time, which led to a sort of synthetic theory which was, "Hey, the life on Earth at 65 million years ago was reset by an extraordinary event.  This event was unpredictable.  It was extraterrestrial in origin.  It's reset the way in which life has evolved on Earth.

Chris -  Fascinating!  Dave Norman from Cambridge University on his paleontological post-mortem of what wiped out the dinosaurs.  If you'd like to know more about how hidden fossils are revealed in rocks, you can listen to a special podcast we'll be putting out tomorrow featuring Sarah Finney, also from the Sedgwick Museum, and that's with Sara Sjosten who you also heard in that piece.  
ChatGPT> The extinction of the dinosaurs, which occurred around 65 million years ago, is believed to have been caused by a combination of multiple factors, with the most widely accepted hypothesis being that a large asteroid impact was the primary cause. This event is known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event, or the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) extinction event.

The asteroid impact theory suggests that a massive asteroid or comet impact, estimated to be about 10 km (6 miles) in diameter, occurred in what is now Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. The impact would have caused massive fires, a "nuclear winter" effect due to dust and debris in the atmosphere, and widespread destruction of ecosystems, resulting in the extinction of many species, including the dinosaurs. The impact would have caused tsunamis, earthquakes, and other global environmental changes that led to the collapse of ecosystems and the decline of the dinosaurs.

In addition to the asteroid impact, other factors may have contributed to the extinction of the dinosaurs, including:

Climate change: There is evidence that the Earth was undergoing significant climate changes during the late Cretaceous period, with cooling and sea level fluctuations. These changes could have disrupted ecosystems and led to the decline of the dinosaurs.

Volcanic activity: There is evidence of widespread volcanic activity during the late Cretaceous period, which could have released large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to global warming and climate change.

Disease and competition: Disease outbreaks or competition with other species could have weakened dinosaur populations, making them more susceptible to extinction.

Habitat disruption: Changes in sea level, sea temperature, and vegetation patterns could have disrupted dinosaur habitats and food sources, leading to their decline.

Biological factors: Changes in plant and animal diversity, or changes in predator-prey dynamics, could have also played a role in the decline and extinction of dinosaurs.

It is likely that a combination of these factors, including the asteroid impact, climate change, volcanic activity, disease, competition, habitat disruption, and biological factors, contributed to the extinction of the dinosaurs. The exact sequence of events and the relative importance of each factor in the extinction of dinosaurs is still a topic of ongoing research and scientific debate among experts.

Q. Reduced sea ice is threatening polar bears in the Arctic. would they thrive at the south pole instead?
GT> Felicity Bedford spoke to Dr Iain Staniland from the British Antarctic Survey to find an answer to this chilly challenge...

Ian - Starving Polar bears desperately clinging to lumps of melting ice is an image that most people relate to regarding global warming and the threats to wildlife and, given their iconic status, it has even been suggested we could save the polar bear by translocating them to the Antarctic.

Felicity - But would they more successful hunting at the South Pole? Let's drop them in and find out.

Ian - Polar bears would do very well if transplanted into the Antarctic - well at least for a few years. From a food point of view it would be polar bear heaven. In the Arctic the seals and other potential prey species have evolved lifestyles that minimises their risk of being eaten by polar bears but, in contrast, larger Antarctic animals such as seals and penguins have evolved without the risk of being eaten. Because of this the penguins are typically quite bold and inquisitive and will often approach you to have a look, and seals in the Antarctic range in behaviour from total indifference to outright aggression. For example Antarctic fur seals have a reputation for chasing and trying to bite people, and whilst this is great for tourism and researchers - well except for getting bitten obviously, it would make Antarctic wildlife the equivalent of an all you can eat buffet as far as Polar bears are concerned. The most obvious effect of putting polar bears into the Antarctic would be a catastrophic decline in the seal and penguin populations and some very fat and happy bears.

Felicity - So far so good for the polar bears, although news isn't so good for the penguins. Are there any other benefits for polar bears in Antarctica?

Ian - Given that most of the industrialised nations are in the northern hemisphere and are encircling the Arctic, it's no surprise that polar bears are basically being poisoned by their food. The remoteness of Antarctica and its greater separation from these sources of pollution means that whilst such toxins abound in the environment, the levels are currently much less significant.

Felicity - Plenty of food and less pollution. This all sounds too good to be true..

Ian - But it's not all good news for the Polar bears, there are also several less obvious factors that come into play. There'll be many unknowns such as the risk of the bears of the exposure to new diseases, and then what would happen when the bears have eaten all the seals and penguins? History teaches us that animal translocations often have unpredictable results and so it's probably best that polar bears and penguins only meet on badly designed Christmas cards.

Felicity - Thanks Ian. I'm sure all penguin lovers will agree, the solution to Polar bear conservation lies in protecting their Arctic habitat, not moving them south.
ChatGPT> Polar bears are adapted to live in the Arctic and are specifically adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the region, including the presence of sea ice, which is critical for their survival. While it might seem logical to consider relocating polar bears to the South Pole in the face of reduced sea ice in the Arctic, there are several reasons why this would not be a feasible or effective solution.

Ecological Adaptations: Polar bears are highly specialized to survive in the Arctic, with unique adaptations to their physical features, physiology, and behavior that are specifically adapted to the Arctic environment. The South Pole, on the other hand, has a very different ecosystem, with a different climate, geography, and species composition. Polar bears would not be well-adapted to survive in the South Pole without undergoing significant evolutionary changes.

Competing Species: The South Pole already has its own set of unique and specialized species, including penguins, seals, and other marine mammals that have evolved to thrive in the extreme conditions of the Antarctic region. Introducing polar bears into this ecosystem could disrupt the delicate balance of the Antarctic food web and potentially lead to competition with native species for limited resources.

Logistics and Ethical Concerns: Relocating polar bears to the South Pole would involve significant logistical challenges, including capturing, transporting, and acclimating the animals to a new environment, which may not be feasible or humane. It would also raise ethical concerns related to the welfare of the animals and potential negative impacts on the native Antarctic ecosystem.

Conservation and Management Efforts: Conservation and management efforts for polar bears should focus on protecting their natural habitat in the Arctic, addressing the root causes of sea ice loss, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and mitigating climate change impacts. Conservation strategies such as reducing human-wildlife conflicts, managing hunting practices, protecting denning areas, and managing tourism in the Arctic can also play a crucial role in ensuring the survival of polar bears in their natural habitat.

In summary, while the idea of relocating polar bears to the South Pole may seem like a solution to the challenges they face in the Arctic, it is not a practical or feasible approach due to ecological adaptations, competing species, logistical challenges, and ethical concerns. Conservation efforts should focus on protecting and conserving their natural habitat in the Arctic and addressing the root causes of sea ice loss and climate change.

Q. What is affecting bird populations in South East England?
GT> At least 4000 species of birds are long-distance migrants: they spend the spring and summer in locations like the UK, where they mate and rear their chicks, and then they fly off somewhere warmer for the winter. But for this to work successfully, the birds have to time their arrival in the spring so it coincides with a big surge in the caterpillars they need for feeding their young, which happens when the trees first burst into leaf. With the climate changing, though, some species are increasingly getting it wrong and arriving too late. So is this to blame for the drop we’re seeing in bird populations in the south of England? Or is something else going on? Chris Smith spoke to Malcolm Burgess from the RSPB and the University of Exeter…

Malcolm - We were trying to find out whether the extent of mismatch, that’s the mismatch between when the chicks are hungriest and the timing of the peak availability of their favourite food, which is caterpillars. We were interested in whether the extent of this mismatch differed between the north and the south of the UK. Our paper shows that spring is later the further north you go.

Chris - How did you actually do the study? What were the questions you were asking and how did you gather the information to nail this?

Malcolm - We’re looking a three levels really: we’re looking at the emergence of the oak leaves, when the caterpillars emerge and when they’re most abundant, and then we were looking at timing of breeding and the breeding success of the birds. We used citizen science datasets for the oak leafing data, we used records that people submit to the UK phenology network.

Chris - What’s that; people going out and asking is that oak in leaf yet?

Malcolm - That’s right. They’re noting down when they first see the buds burst of the oak trees right across the UK.

Chris - And the caterpillars and the birds?

Malcolm - The caterpillars is a bit harder. But I linked up to somebody called Ken Smith who’s come up with a very simple idea of collecting caterpillar droppings in a simple seed tray which we put underneath oak trees in woods across the UK all through the spring. Caterpillar poo is cylindrical in shape, so it means that we can separate it from everything else that falls in the traps, dry it and weigh it, and from that we an see very clearly actually, when the peak in the availability of caterpillars is.

Chris - What about the arrival of the birds; how did you log that?

Malcolm - We looked at both resident birds, which is blue tits and great tits which are in our woodlands all year round, and the migratory pied flycatcher. We measure their time of year breeding by monitoring their nests and, as part of the British Trust for Ornithology’s nest record scheme, many thousands of these nests are monitored each year, mostly again by citizen scientists. And we’re able to use this information from across the UK to quantify timing of egg laying, when the chicks hatch. And when they’re ten days old is when they require the most food and that’s the moment that needs to coincide with the peak availability of caterpillars.

Chris - Bringing all of this information together, what trends emerge; what did you find?

Malcolm - We found that spring was later in the north but, importantly, the extent of mismatch in any one year didn’t vary across the UK, so a population in the north of the UK is just as mismatched as the population in the south. That’s really important because declines of many insectivorous birds and many migratory birds isn’t uniform across the UK. The declines are greater in southern England and it’s been very often linked to this mismatch theory, but importantly we show that that isn’t actually the case, there are other things driving these declines.

Chris - Obviously, the south is experiencing quite considerable development. So do you think that it’s a population/development/agricultural impact, all these things working together and they’re affecting the environment and that’s what’s impacting the birds?

Malcolm - Those things will certainly all affect the birds, yes. Particularly thinking again about insectivorous birds, all those things are detrimental to availability of insects. I’m sure that many of us can remember when we were younger the amount of insects that would hit our car windscreens which really doesn’t happen anymore. So yes, any development and agricultural intensifications have been well shown to affect insectivorous and seed-eating farmland birds for example.
ChatGPT> There are several factors that may be affecting bird populations in South East England. Some of the main factors include:

Habitat loss and fragmentation: As urbanization and land development continue to expand in South East England, bird habitats such as woodlands, wetlands, and grasslands are being lost or fragmented. This can result in the loss of suitable nesting sites, foraging grounds, and shelter for birds, leading to declines in bird populations.

Agricultural practices: Intensive agricultural practices, such as the use of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, can have negative impacts on bird populations. These chemicals can directly harm birds, reduce their food sources, and alter their natural habitats. Changes in farming practices, such as the loss of hedgerows and traditional crop rotations, can also have detrimental effects on bird populations.

Climate change: Climate change can affect bird populations through changes in temperature, precipitation, and weather patterns. These changes can alter bird habitats, including changes in migration patterns, availability of food, and availability of suitable nesting sites. Climate change can also impact bird populations indirectly by affecting their prey populations and disrupting ecological balance.

Invasive species: Invasive species, such as non-native plants and animals, can outcompete native species for resources, alter habitats, and disrupt local ecosystems. In South East England, invasive species such as the grey squirrel and ring-necked parakeet can negatively impact bird populations by outcompeting native bird species for food and nesting sites.

Human activities: Human activities, such as pollution, hunting, and disturbance, can also have negative impacts on bird populations. Pollution from industries, agriculture, and urban areas can contaminate water bodies and food sources, leading to declines in bird populations. Hunting and illegal poaching can also directly impact bird populations, especially for rare or threatened species. Disturbance from human activities, such as recreational activities, can disrupt bird behavior, nesting, and feeding patterns.

Disease and predation: Disease outbreaks and predation by other animals can also affect bird populations. Outbreaks of avian diseases, such as avian influenza or avian malaria, can result in declines in bird populations. Predation by introduced predators, such as domestic cats, foxes, and rats, can also impact bird populations, especially ground-nesting species.

It's important to note that these factors often interact with each other, and the exact impacts on bird populations in South East England can vary depending on the species, habitat, and other local factors. Conservation efforts, including habitat conservation, restoration, and management, reducing pesticide use, addressing climate change, controlling invasive species, and regulating human activities, can play a crucial role in protecting and conserving bird populations in South East England and beyond.

Q. What is the result of the recent study in UK to investigate the link between biodiversity and the services nature provides, such as food, clean air, water and flood protection?
GT> A major seven-year study has been launched in the UK to investigate the link between biodiversity and the services nature provides;  Such as food, clean air, water and flood protection.

Planet Earth Podcast presenter Richard Hollingham went to meet the leader of the project, Dave Raffaelli from the University of York, at Blacktoft Sands nature reserve on the banks of the River Humber in South Yorkshire.

The reserve is home to a herd of wild Konik ponies as well as a multitude of bird species. Looking out from a bird hide across the marshes, Dave explained about the benefits of biodiversity...

Dave - If you look out at the area we're looking at at the moment you can see it's dominated mostly by reeds.  These have many, many functions in the natural environment that people don't really appreciate. Traditionally they were used for thatching, for making roofs and so on, but they have many other really interesting functions. So, they provide a kind of soft engineering for storm surges and for wave action and so on which means that we don't have to build solid seawalls, so they take the energy out of the waves. They also filter water before it goes from agricultural land into the rivers and strip out all the nitrates and so on. So they have a purification function, they have a storm defense function as well as providing lots of biodiversity for us as well.

Richard -   And these sorts of functions they're termed ecosystem services and that's what your project is investigating and looking at - a rather ugly word but I suppose it describes what it does.

Konik, displaying dorsal line & other physical featuresDave -   Yes, I think the best way to think about them is that nature provides lots of benefits for us and this is one of several habitats we're looking at in the United Kingdom, so we're looking at coastal marshes like these, we're looking at upland rivers, we're looking at lowland farms and we're looking at urban areas as well down south in England and we hope to extend that to many other kinds of habitats.  Each of these habitats has lots of biodiversity which provides those kinds of benefits for us.  Food production from agricultural land, in an area like this there's lots of recreation provided for us as well as climate regulation in forests and so on and what we're trying to do is find out how much of that biodiversity you really need to sustain those benefits in a changing world.

Richard -   So are you trying to quantify this and put numbers on this and say "we need this many reeds to stop the flooding here" or "we need this diversity of plants and insects..."

Dave -   That's right and unless we quantify those then they won't be valued properly in decision making. Many of these so called benefits from the landscape, these ecosystem services, they don't actually have monetary value attached to them because we can't trade them. But, actually, if we didn't have them then we would have problems with flooding, we would have problems associated with climate change, carbon sequestration and so on.  We're trying to put numbers of those so that when we need to make decisions about the way we manage our landscapes in the UK we can do that on a properly informed basis.

Richard -   And so when we peer out through this slit across the water in front of us; it's almost like a pond, it's so still today, there's no wind at all.  Then there's the reeds and then there's a butterfly just flitting past, there's a pony in the distance and then the river and then into a haze of the hill and trees. You put numbers and say, right we need that and that will mean we get this amount of benefit from that?

Dave -   That right. So the kind of trade-offs that people like the Environment Agency, for instance, have to make on a daily basis but we all do in society is what should we do about whether we want to build sea defences to stop flooding or river defences to stop flooding? One of the decisions that we might want to make is not to invest huge amounts of money into those sea defences but maybe to purchase adjacent agricultural land, which also has monetary value, in order to let that land accommodate the flood rather than trying to stop it and then pushing the water further downstream. So that's why we're trying to put the numbers on these benefits so that people can have a common currency, if you like.  It doesn't have to be money it can be anything, but a common currency to provide a rational basis for actually making those kinds of decisions.

Richard -   I'm just watching that pony over there swishing its tail, swishing the flies away, grazing on the marsh, grazing on some sort of grass or sedge or something over there.  How do you put a number on the benefit of that grazing, or benefit or otherwise of that?

Dave -   Well that's what the project is really all about. What we want to know is, and that's a very good example for this konik pony, is how many konik ponies do you need to change the vegetation in such a way and keep it in a particular condition but it's the best possible condition to stop flooding?  Although it all looks like reed here there is many, many species and the essential question is how many species of these reeds and sedges do you actually need in order to provide that benefit of flood regulation or water purification for us and of course the konik pony is one of the moderators of that biodiversity because by feeding selectively they can increase the diversity or decrease it, so that's a very good example of why biodiversity is important in these questions.
ChatGPT> As an AI language model, I do not have access to real-time data or recent studies, and "TK" is a placeholder for missing information. However, I can provide a general overview of the link between biodiversity and the services that nature provides.

Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth, including the diversity of species, ecosystems, and genetic diversity within species. Biodiversity plays a crucial role in providing a wide range of ecosystem services, which are the benefits that nature provides to humans. These ecosystem services include, but are not limited to:

Food: Biodiversity provides the foundation for food production through diverse crop plants, livestock, and aquatic species. Many of the foods we eat, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, and fish, rely on diverse ecosystems and species.

Clean air and water: Biodiverse ecosystems, such as forests, wetlands, and mangroves, help filter and purify air and water, contributing to clean air and water resources that are essential for human health and well-being.

Flood protection: Biodiverse ecosystems, such as wetlands and coastal marshes, can act as natural buffers against floods by absorbing and storing excess water, reducing the risk of flooding in nearby areas.

Climate regulation: Biodiversity plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate by capturing and storing carbon, regulating temperature and precipitation patterns, and contributing to resilience against climate change impacts.

Pollination: Biodiversity, including wild pollinators such as bees, butterflies, and birds, plays a critical role in pollinating many crops and wild plants, ensuring their reproduction and contributing to food production.

Medicines and other resources: Biodiversity provides a vast array of medicinal plants, as well as other resources such as timber, fibers, and fuelwood, which are essential for human livelihoods and well-being.

Recent studies have provided evidence of the strong link between biodiversity and the services that nature provides. These studies highlight the importance of conserving and protecting biodiversity as a means to sustain the services that nature provides, which are vital for human well-being, food security, and the overall health of ecosystems. Understanding and valuing the link between biodiversity and ecosystem services can inform decision-making, policies, and conservation efforts aimed at protecting and conserving biodiversity for the benefit of present and future generations.

Q. We should definitely conserve everything that we can. Mankind is responsible for the biggest loss of species on mother Earth. We don't know, yet, what will be required to ensure our survival in the future. How should we conserving for future genetic resources?
GT> We should definitely conserve everything that we can. Mankind is responsible for the biggest loss of species on mother Earth. We don't know, yet, what will be required to ensure our survival in the future. Thus we should be having a maximum of reserves within the gene pool to be able to react on collapsing eco systems.

Gareth - I think the coming approach now with this capacity to sequence at huge levels is to just do all the DNA in the habitat and whilst you can also see what organisms are there, you also are looking at individual genes and pathways. And that's going to explore huge biotechnological potential.

Ben - So, it's not just looking at interesting DNA, but actually, how all of these fit together, also, the epigenetic factors, the things that control the expression of different genes.

Gareth - Yes. There's a fair bit of work to do having done that as well because you got to put them together into genome sequences and work out the genetic pathways that make these novel pathways work. There is huge scope there. I think it's going to be quite transformative of our knowledge of the processes that happen in these natural ecosystems.
ChatGPT> Conserving genetic resources for the future is an important aspect of biodiversity conservation. Genetic resources refer to the genetic diversity within species, including their unique traits and genetic makeup. Genetic diversity is crucial for the adaptation and resilience of species to changing environmental conditions, and it can be a valuable source of genetic material for future uses, such as crop improvement, medicinal research, and ecosystem restoration.

Here are some key considerations for conserving genetic resources for future generations:

Protected areas and conservation areas: Establishing protected areas, such as national parks, wildlife reserves, and gene banks, can help conserve genetic resources by providing safe havens for species and their genetic diversity. Conservation areas can also be established on private lands, indigenous territories, and community-managed areas, with the involvement and consent of local communities.

In situ conservation: In situ conservation involves conserving genetic resources in their natural habitats. This can be achieved through various strategies such as maintaining intact ecosystems, restoring degraded habitats, and managing threatened or endangered species and their habitats. In situ conservation efforts can help ensure the long-term survival of species and their genetic diversity in their natural environments.

Ex situ conservation: Ex situ conservation involves conserving genetic resources outside of their natural habitats, such as in gene banks, seed banks, botanical gardens, and captive breeding programs. These facilities can store genetic material, such as seeds, pollen, embryos, tissues, and DNA, and can serve as repositories of genetic diversity for future uses.

Sustainable use and management: Sustainable use and management of genetic resources can contribute to their conservation. This includes practices such as sustainable harvesting of wild species, traditional and local knowledge systems, and sustainable management of domesticated species, such as crop landraces and livestock breeds. Sustainable use can also support local livelihoods, traditional practices, and cultural heritage.

Policy and legal frameworks: Effective policy and legal frameworks can play a crucial role in conserving genetic resources for the future. This includes regulations, laws, and international agreements that promote biodiversity conservation, access and benefit-sharing, and protection of traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources. These frameworks can provide incentives for conservation, regulate access to genetic resources, and ensure that the benefits of their use are shared equitably.

Education and awareness: Educating and raising awareness among local communities, stakeholders, and the general public about the value of genetic resources, their conservation, and sustainable use is essential. This can include promoting environmental education, traditional knowledge, and cultural practices that contribute to the conservation of genetic resources.

Conserving genetic resources for the future requires a multi-faceted approach that integrates in situ and ex situ conservation, sustainable use and management, policy and legal frameworks, and education and awareness. It is crucial to involve local communities, indigenous peoples, and other stakeholders in the conservation process and respect their traditional knowledge, practices, and rights. By conserving genetic resources, we can ensure the resilience and adaptability of species to changing environmental conditions and safeguard valuable genetic material for the benefit of present and future generations.

Q. Is is true that climate change could be changing how our coffee tastes in years to come?
GT> New research out of London’s Kew Gardens warns that climate change will significantly affect where we can grow coffee in the future, which may well affect the flavour. Georgia Mills went along to the Cambridge University Botanic Gardens, with Glasshouse Supervisor Alex Summers, to hunt for some coffee beans...

Alex - The whole bit back there is just coffee, so this is all coffee here.

Georgia - There’s no beans on show at the moment. I guess it’s the wrong time of year?

Alex - Absolutely. Our coffee tends to produce flowers and fruits later in the year and, as you can see at the moment, we have nothing.

Georgia - But you do have a coffee machine?

Alex - We do indeed have a coffee machine. I think like all institutions, many days are run on the back of coffee.

Georgia - You have coffee beans growing here at the botanic gardens. We just saw them, they’re in a greenhouse. They can only grow in certain places in the world?

Alex - Absolutely. Coffee in itself is what we think of as a tropical crop; that means that it can grow in latitudes between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. Even within those latitudes they’ll still be areas that it can and can’t grow. So if you can imagine within the tropics, you might get the really hot lowland plains, and you might get those cooler more montane environments. In the situation of those cooler more montane environments the temperatures never get to quite the extremes that you would see in the lowlands. Coffee, in itself, is from the Ethiopian highlands and they’re a cooler tropical environment.

So let’s go with a Colombian coffee…

Georgia - So despite spilling half of it, Alex brewed up a rather excellent cup of Colombian coffee. But will this soon be a luxury of the past? Because a paper out in Nature Genetics has used modeling to predict that 39 to 59% of our current coffee growing areas could be rendered unsuitable by climate change…

Alex - I think this is an interesting thing to bring up because I think it’s the case for many plants from many environments. The fact is that climate change in happening, it’s coming along, and that affects the temperature environment in which many of these plants grow. So, in the case of coffee, we’ve spoken that it’s from these more montane parts of the tropics. What that means is as temperatures rise, it has a tendency to force coffee itself out of the locations that we tend to find it. Probably higher up the mountain ranges or the bits of the Ethiopian highlands that it’s found in. If that means you’re a coffee farmer, it might mean that some of the areas you're currently using to farm become unsuitable environmentally. Probably become too hot or probably have a climate which changes enough that you’re unable to grow the coffee there to the same extent, and to the same efficiency that you’ve been growing it there previously.

Georgia - What does this mean for the future of our coffee supply?

Alex - The thing with climate change is that it’s not even. Whilst certain habitats will become unfit for coffee there will be other ones that open up that will become fit for coffee. I think what essentially this paper is highlighting is that there are many areas that we are going to lose for coffee growers, but there will be many areas that will then become available for coffee to be cultivated in. I think what it highlights is in this changing world is that we’re going to have to be flexible to changing our cultivation practices, and also to make land available where it’s required to grow coffee. But it does mean that we have to be cautious to look after what we’ve got so the good agricultural land we’ve go we have to look after. Being sustainable with our practices so that we don’t ruin areas so that we can’t move into them in the future. Also, for those bits of natural habitat and environment that we’ve still got left that hold huge diversity that can be bred into these crops to change them in the future as we need to that we don’t absolutely destroy that either. So I think that it’s a pragmatic approach.

Georgia - So there is hope for the humble coffee bean. It may move location, which can affect the flavour and the prices, but if we’re careful with our practices, we will still be able to get hold of it. But what about the growers?

Alex - If you’re a local farmer and you farm a particular area, and that area then becomes unsuitable for coffee cultivation, it’s not as simple for you to pick up your land, move it to a new suitable location and go ahead. So I think in these cases here we also have to be aware of the effects it has at a local scale. Not just at the national scale where we can say positively that we’ll be able to move the coffee cultivation from one location to another, we also need to understand how it’s going to affect the local communities who depend on that for a livelihood.
ChatGPT> Yes, climate change could potentially impact the taste and quality of coffee in the years to come. Coffee is a tropical crop that is highly sensitive to changes in temperature, precipitation, and other climatic factors. As the climate changes, it can affect the growing conditions for coffee plants, which in turn may impact the flavor, aroma, and quality of coffee beans.

Here are some ways in which climate change could potentially impact coffee taste:

Shifts in growing regions: Climate change can lead to changes in suitable growing regions for coffee. Some traditional coffee growing regions may become less suitable for coffee cultivation due to shifts in temperature, precipitation patterns, and other factors. This may result in the need to cultivate coffee in new regions with different environmental conditions, which can potentially impact the flavor and aroma of coffee beans.

Changes in precipitation: Changes in precipitation patterns, including alterations in rainfall amounts and distribution, can impact coffee growth and development. Too much or too little rain can affect the growth and ripening of coffee cherries, potentially affecting the flavor and quality of the beans. For example, prolonged droughts can result in reduced yields and lower quality beans, while excessive rainfall can lead to increased disease and pest pressure, and may also impact the flavor profile of coffee.

Rising temperatures: Coffee plants have specific temperature requirements for optimal growth and development. As temperatures rise due to climate change, it can impact the physiology, metabolism, and overall growth of coffee plants. Higher temperatures can affect the maturation process of coffee cherries, potentially resulting in changes in flavor, aroma, and quality of coffee beans.

Pests and diseases: Climate change can also impact the distribution and abundance of pests and diseases that affect coffee plants. Warmer temperatures and altered precipitation patterns can create favorable conditions for the proliferation of pests and diseases, which can potentially impact the quality and yield of coffee beans.

Agronomic practices: Climate change can also influence agronomic practices, such as irrigation, fertilization, and shade management, which can impact the flavor and quality of coffee. Changes in water availability, nutrient availability, and shading practices can affect the growth, development, and flavor profile of coffee beans.

It is important to note that the impacts of climate change on coffee taste and quality may vary depending on the specific coffee-growing regions, coffee species or cultivars, and local agricultural practices. However, research indicates that climate change has the potential to impact the sensory attributes of coffee, which may have implications for the flavor, aroma, and quality of coffee beans in the future. Efforts to mitigate climate change, promote sustainable coffee farming practices, and support coffee farmers in adapting to changing conditions are important steps towards safeguarding the taste and quality of coffee for future generations.

Q. What does climate change mean for butterflies in the UK?
GT> We can’t talk about plant life without mentioning the animals that live in and around them. And pollinators are often in the news, with worries around declining numbers, and the impact on biodiversity and crop production. Andrew Bladon works at Cambridge University, where he’s done field work - literally - looking at how butterflies respond to temperature change. And he spoke to Chris Smith...

Andrew - So like many species, butterflies are showing effects of climate change at the population level. So we've seen that species are moving North in Europe and North America. And similarly to the plants that Chantal was talking about, species that are adapted to mountains tend to be declining and they're becoming more and more restricted. And there are also changes in behaviour. So species start to emerge earlier in warmer years. But all of these sort of population level changes that we can detect are likely to be caused by individual butterflies' responses to temperature. But we actually know very little about how butterflies respond on an individual level. So what we were trying to find out was exactly that - what do butterflies do to respond to temperature at fine scale? And can we link that to what's happening at a large scale?

Chris - And of course, the butterflies that do inhabit different environments that have different ranges of temperatures are going to be affected differently, in the way that you've just been identifying. So are there therefore some winners and some losers here?

Andrew - Yeah. So the interesting thing is that at the population level, research by butterfly conservation and long term monitoring over the last 40 years has shown that despite the fact that our climate is probably improving for the majority of species, about two thirds to three quarters of our species are still declining. The suspicion is that that's because there's still a big effect of habitat fragmentation and habitat loss on species. But within that, there are a few, a small number of species that are doing quite well. And species that are expanding their ranges northwards quite rapidly. And those generally tend to be the species that are more ubiquitous. They're the ones that can do well in lots of different environments. And they can survive in lots of different environments.

Chris - So the winners just win more and the ones that are already a bit vulnerable, they're finding it even harder to cope. Do you actually know, when you look at those winners and losers, do you know what it is that sets them apart? Why some are just a bit more resilient and some are more vulnerable?

Andrew - That's something that we've been looking at specifically in terms of how they adapt their behaviour to different temperatures. But I'm going to hold off a little bit on telling you the results of that, because we've got a paper coming out in a couple of weeks. So if you watch this space, there should be more answers coming very, very soon. In general, as, as you'd expect really, species that are more able to cope with a broad range of temperatures, those that are able to adapt generally to a wider range of temperatures, tend to be doing better. And those which are very specialist and have very specific temperature requirements tend to be doing worse.

Chris - What about the services they provide to the plants? I started this by referring to the fact they are pollinators. People often overlook the role of the lepidoptera - butterflies, moths etc - in terms of their contribution to the pollination effort. What has been the impact of these changes on what will be the impact of these changes on our plants and flowers and crops getting pollinated?

Andrew - Yeah, so you're exactly right. So about 85% of crops within the EU are insect pollinated. And most people assume that that's all done by bees. But in fact, honey bees, which people think of as the most common pollinators, only actually pollinate about five to 15% of crops, which leaves the other 85 to 95% to be pollinated by bumblebees, solitary bees, moths and butterflies, hover flies, beetles, and all sorts of other insects. And so actually the diversity of the insect community is really, really important for crop pollination and is estimated to be worth hundreds of billions of pounds annually.

Chris - And so if we take your findings and we extrapolate them to what the impact might be on pollination of crops, does that mean it's automatically a worrying picture? Or is it just that because we don't think the overall numbers of pollinators are going to go down, just the diversity is going to drop, actually, we probably will get away with it?

Andrew - The loss of numbers is worrying, but as you say, because some are going up, there's potentially some buffering there, but the thing is that because insect numbers fluctuate quite wildly from year to year. And so some species will do well in one year and then badly another year. And at the same time, a different species will do badly in the first year and well in another year. And by having that diversity of insect pollinators in the landscape, it means that actually we can be more resilient. So in any given year, we've got more options for the species that can pollinate our crops. The worrying thing is that if we lose some of that diversity, we become less resilient. And so there are fewer options for species to pollinate and therefore the chances of us having a really bad year where pollination fails becomes more and more likely. And, actually, the reliance that we currently have and is developing worldwide on the honeybee for pollination is particularly worrying. Because essentially if something bad happens to honeybees, we've lost the diversity of wild insect pollinators that could be able to pick up the pieces.

Chris - What can gardeners do to help?

Andrew - One thing is plant a wide range of wildflowers, to help give insects a helping hand, things that flower throughout the season. Another thing is to try and reduce the use of pesticides and herbicides because they are directly killing our insects. And the final thing is to try and actually be messier in the garden. Mow less, and leave some taller vegetation, which helps insects to survive through the winter.

Chris - Andrew, thank you.

We also put this to University of Sheffield horticulturalist Ross Cameron...

Chris - So, Ross, basically mow less, chuck fewer chemicals on, have a messier garden. Would you go along with that?

Ross - Yeah. In principle, I would. I mean, I think we can go back to nature a little bit in the design of our gardens in that the slightly rougher approach provides a lot of benefits. It's a benefit for wildlife, but even for what I mentioned earlier about capturing rain, holding water, the ability to provide a better microclimate for wildlife, but also for ourselves, goes along with a slightly more relaxed attitude to gardens. And at the end of the day gardens are places we want to enjoy. And quite a lot of enjoyment comes from seeing nature. So gardens without butterflies, without birds are pretty poor soul, really.

Chris - Lawn. A well manicured lawn is often seen as the thing we all aspire to, but actually one person described these things as a sort of biodiversity desert, a horrible mono-culture that's very, very demanding on our time, of our input and returns very little value. A) is that true? And B) therefore, should I get rid of my lawn? And if so, what should I replace it with?

Ross - Yeah, the green desert! Look, manicured lawns have their place. If you happen to be in the luxury of having a croquet lawn or a grass tennis court, it has to be close mown and functional. The reality is most of us do a lot of management of our lawns, which are not necessarily to our benefit. You can let the lawn grow a bit longer. You can get the wildflowers coming in. You can have the pollinators and insects, and you can also retain that degree of respectability. We're using what we call "cues to care". So if you cut paths where through it, if you keep certain parts of it tidy, you can actually still have the best of both worlds, nice legible walkable paths through the garden. And at the same time, allowing some rough and ready spots within the lawn that actually attracts the wildlife and provides that resilience.
ChatGPT> Climate change can have both positive and negative impacts on butterflies in the UK, but overall, it is likely to pose significant challenges to their survival and population dynamics. Here are some potential impacts of climate change on butterflies in the UK:

Shifts in distribution: As temperatures and other environmental conditions change, butterflies may shift their distribution in response. Some species may expand their range northwards, while others may contract or even disappear from certain areas. This can result in changes in butterfly diversity and abundance in different regions of the UK.

Altered phenology: Climate change can impact the timing of key life cycle events for butterflies, such as emergence from overwintering, mating, and egg-laying. Changes in temperature and precipitation can affect the timing of plant flowering, which can in turn affect the availability of nectar and host plants for butterflies. Shifts in phenology can disrupt the delicate timing relationships between butterflies and their host plants, potentially leading to declines in butterfly populations.

Changes in habitat suitability: Climate change can impact the suitability of habitat for butterflies. Some species may lose suitable habitat due to changes in temperature, precipitation, or other factors, while others may gain suitable habitat in new areas. However, many butterfly species have specific habitat requirements, such as host plants for larval development, and changes in habitat availability and quality can impact their survival and reproduction.

Increased competition and predation: Changes in species distributions and abundance due to climate change can alter species interactions, including competition and predation. As some species shift their ranges or become more abundant in certain areas, it can result in increased competition for resources, including food and habitat, among butterflies. It can also result in changes in predator-prey relationships, potentially affecting butterfly survival and population dynamics.

Increased risk of extinction: Climate change can increase the risk of extinction for some butterfly species, particularly those that are already threatened or have limited distributions. Changes in habitat availability, suitability, and species interactions can exacerbate existing threats to butterfly populations, potentially leading to local extinctions or declines in overall population size.

Adaptation challenges: Butterflies may face challenges in adapting to the rapid pace of climate change. Some species may be able to adapt through genetic changes or behavioral adjustments, such as changes in flight patterns or phenology. However, the ability of butterflies to adapt to changing conditions may be limited by factors such as their dispersal ability, reproductive strategies, and availability of suitable habitat.

It is important to note that the impacts of climate change on butterflies in the UK can be complex and may vary depending on the specific species, their ecological requirements, and local environmental conditions. Conservation efforts, including habitat restoration, monitoring, and adaptive management, are important for mitigating the potential negative impacts of climate change on butterflies and supporting their long-term survival.

Q. From where should scientists collect seeds to conserve tree species?
GT> When conservationists are seeking to restore woodland and regenerate populations of endangered tree species, where should they go to collect seeds? One school of thought says it’s best to source them locally, since locally-growing specimens may be carrying genes that confer advantages for that specific environment. But, actually, we didn’t know over what ranges trees could exchange genes, or how climate change might feature in the equation. Now, thanks to Megan Supple’s study on one strain of Australia Eucalypt, we have a much better idea, and Chris Smith hears what it is…

Megan - We were interested in asking whether we can build more resilient plant communities through restoration, in particular by incorporating climate change models into seed sourcing decisions.

Chris - And what strategies are there at the moment for doing that?

Megan - So we focused really on seed sourcing, so in terms of how you source your seeds for restoration, it's often quite local. You select seeds that are from near the restoration site with the hope that they are best adapted to the local conditions.

Chris - Right, so what's wrong with that strategy or why shouldn't that be a sound approach?

Megan - Well, it can go awry when you're planting a long-lived species such as a tree in a changing environment. So they're locally adapted to the current conditions but the conditions are changing and so they may not be adapted to future conditions.

Chris - But aren't you sort of asking for the arboreal equivalent of a crystal ball, because no one knows what climate change is going to do to a different geography and no one knows how the species or any species is going to respond to that?

Megan - That's true and so there's climate models out there. They're not perfect, but we can make a best guess as to what we think will be the best seed sourcing strategy. And in particular one of the issues with going quite locally is you have a reduced gene pool to select from. And so when you begin to source more broadly you can incorporate more diversity and then you have that genetic variation there that you need for these unknown things in the future.

Chris - So why doesn't everyone just say "Well the simple solution is then to just source really broadly because then I'll have loads of diversity and I've safeguarded the future?"

Megan - Because they're quite worried about this idea of local adaptation, that over long periods of time these plants have become locally adapted to their environment where they live. And so that potentially seeds from further out might not do well in that environment so there's a real concern about local adaptation.

Chris - So how did you pursue it? What did you do to try and nail which is the more dominant or more important determinant?

Megan - What we did is through a citizen science program, we obtain leaf samples from trees across this species distribution, and then we genotype those at about 10000 genetic markers. Using those markers we generated a model explaining how those markers are associated with geographic location and the climate variables at those sites. Then using that model we can project the model on to predict future climates to see how we expect that different genotypes will fare in different climates.

Chris - And what emerged?

Megan - The first big finding was, we looked just at the patterns of gene flow across the landscape. And so now remember these are 200 year old trees. And so we're really looking at a historical baseline of natural gene flow prior to a lot of the habitat fragmentation that we see now. And we found the gene flow extends really far. We estimated it extends beyond 500 kilometers. That means then when sourcing seeds we can source quite broadly across the landscape and mimic that and have that historical gene flow.

Chris - So when you say gene flow this means that a tree in position A, there's evidence from your data that that's been exchanging genes with trees up to 500 kilometres away?

Megan - Yes.

Chris - So that's a big distribution isn't it?

Megan - Yes it's quite broad. So in some of these species historically they would source seeds from within 15 kilometres of the restoration site.

Chris - But can there not be superimposed on some of these gene flows from further afield, more local effects so you could actually have both things going on so you could be still robbing Peter to pay Paul if you go too far afield?

Megan - So we did not specifically look at those local adaptation and very specific genes, we took a genome wide approach to look at the overall genome signal. But one thing we can do in a future study is use the data that we've collected here and begin to look at that.

Chris - You also looked at one particular eucalypt in Australia didn't you? So what extent can I say right okay that applies to eucalypts in general or that applies to an oak tree? Are they likely to be quite different or quite similar?

Megan - I think there will be similarities in other tree species that have similar pollen flow. And so while this analysis is particular to this specific species, I would think that in species with similar life histories you would expect to see a similar pattern.

Chris - Did you look at epigenetic effects as well because that's become apparent in recent years, that we can see this having a heritable effect so that species can react to the exigencies or particular opportunities in a particular environment? Now you wouldn't see that if you just looked at the genetic code would you?

Megan -  No and we would not see that with this and we did not look for epigenetic effects, and it's hard because these are really complex systems that have a lot of things going on and so we focused on these two particular things of gene flow and climate change.

Chris - So pulling it all together then, if you were now writing the guidebook on how one should collect seed to restore a species or ensure and safeguard the future of a species, what are your bullet point take home messages that this study suggests we should adopt?

Megan - So the first thing I think for this species is again going more broadly across the landscape, and so incorporating seeds from a wider distribution to incorporate more of that genetic diversity that naturally occurs in this species. And the second thing would be; we generated a model that allows us to predict how well different genotypes will perform at a different restoration site. And so from that we can generate a map that suggests where are the best collection sites for a given restoration site and so that's a useful tool because you can incorporate that with other knowledge that you have to figure out where your best likelihood of success is.
ChatGPT> Scientists collecting seeds to conserve tree species should ideally collect them from diverse, healthy, and representative populations of the species' natural habitat. Here are some considerations for collecting seeds for tree species conservation:

In situ conservation: In situ conservation involves conserving trees in their natural habitats. Collecting seeds from wild populations of trees can help maintain the genetic diversity of the species, including adaptation to local environmental conditions. Ideally, seeds should be collected from a range of individuals and populations to capture the genetic diversity of the species.

Priority populations: Priority populations for seed collection should be identified based on various factors, such as their genetic diversity, geographic representation, and ecological significance. Populations that are at risk due to habitat loss, climate change, or other threats may be given higher priority for seed collection to ensure their conservation.

Healthy trees: Seeds should be collected from healthy trees to ensure good genetic quality and viability. Trees that show signs of disease, stress, or other abnormalities should be avoided as they may have reduced genetic fitness.

Representative populations: Seeds should be collected from representative populations that reflect the natural range of the species, including different geographic regions, altitudes, and habitats. This can help capture the full genetic diversity of the species and ensure that the conserved seeds are well-adapted to a range of environmental conditions.

Local knowledge: Local knowledge and involvement of local communities and indigenous peoples can be invaluable in seed collection efforts. They often have traditional knowledge about the species, their distribution, and ecological requirements, and can provide guidance on appropriate collection methods and timing.

Legal and ethical considerations: Seed collection should be carried out in compliance with local laws and regulations, including obtaining necessary permits or permissions. Ethical considerations, such as respect for indigenous rights, community engagement, and benefit-sharing, should also be taken into account in seed collection efforts.

Genetic diversity: Genetic diversity is important for the long-term survival and adaptability of tree species. Seeds should be collected from a diverse range of individuals and populations to capture as much genetic diversity as possible, including both common and rare genetic variants.

Seed handling: Proper seed handling techniques should be followed to ensure seed viability and quality. Seeds should be collected at the right stage of maturity, cleaned, and stored under appropriate conditions to maintain their viability and prevent damage or contamination.

It is important to note that seed collection for conservation purposes should be carried out with careful planning, documentation, and adherence to best practices to ensure the sustainability and effectiveness of conservation efforts. Collaboration among scientists, local communities, and relevant stakeholders is crucial in seed collection efforts for tree species conservation.

Q. Giant pandas have proven really hard to breed, but is this because they have no sex drive?
GT> It's mythconception time, and as spring - and maybe love - is in the air, Kat Arney has been finding Male Giant Panda out if giant pandas just don't fancy it.

Kat - Easter, or rather springtime, has been associated with fertility in human culture for many thousands of years. It's not for nothing that we have Easter bunnies and eggs, and the arrival of longer, warmer days is guaranteed to get the sap rising. But while bunnies are often said to have no problems in the reproductive department, giant pandas are allegedly terrible at romance - which apparently explains their poor track record at producing baby pandas.

But a new study from US-based conservation researchers working at the Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding centre in China suggests that this might not be true: pandas do enjoy getting frisky, but only if they actually fancy the other panda in the partnership.

Thanks to poaching and destruction of their natural habitat, giant pandas are an endangered species, with just a couple of thousand left in the wild. The only hope to save the pandas is to breed them in captivity, but although the Chinese breeding centre does manage to churn out super-cute baby pandas on a fairly regular basis, this hasn't been quite the roaring success that researchers might have hoped. And panda pairs in zoos seem to be extremely reluctant to get down to it - as witnessed by the rollercoaster of excitement and disappointment around Tian Tian, Edinburgh zoo's female panda and her possible pregnancies.

When breeding giant pandas in captivity, conservationists tend to try and pair up animals with the lowest levels of genetic similarity or relatedness, to try and avoid inbreeding. But researcher Meghan Martin-Wintle noticed that if a female panda at the Chengdu centre was given the choice of two males, one of which with 'good' different genes and one with more similar genes, she tended to ignore the genetically ideal male and lavish her affections on the other one.

And if she was encouraged to breed with the genetically preferable male, they either didn't manage to get it on, or she didn't manage to get pregnant. But if she was allowed to get up close and personal with the panda she fancied the most, the female was twice as likely to give birth to a cub. And if the attraction was mutual, there was an impressive 80 per cent chance that love would be in the air, with an equally high success rate in producing cubs.

There are other factors at play here too, including whether the pandas had been hand-reared by humans, along with their age and size - it turns out that being a larger, older male gives you a better chance of becoming a panda dad.

So it seems that the pandas and their sex lives have been unfairly maligned by the media. It turns out that they're just like the rest of us: if you want to get frisky, it helps if you fancy the other party - or panda.
ChatGPT> Giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) are known for their low reproductive rates in captivity, which has presented challenges for breeding and conservation efforts. While their reproductive behavior and physiology are complex and unique, it is not accurate to say that giant pandas have no sex drive.

Giant pandas have a relatively short mating season that typically occurs once a year, lasting only a few days. During this time, male pandas become sexually active and actively seek out females for mating. However, female pandas have a very narrow window of fertility, which makes successful mating in captivity challenging. Additionally, male pandas may not always exhibit strong mating behaviors or may have difficulty mating due to various factors, such as inexperience or health issues.

Furthermore, captive giant pandas, especially those born and raised in captivity, may exhibit reduced sexual behaviors and reproductive success compared to their wild counterparts. This could be due to a range of factors, including lack of exposure to natural environmental cues, limited opportunities for socialization, and potential genetic factors related to their captive breeding history.

Efforts to breed giant pandas in captivity often involve complex and carefully managed protocols, including natural mating, artificial insemination, and other reproductive techniques. These efforts are aimed at maximizing the chances of successful mating and reproduction in captivity. Despite the challenges, there have been successful breeding programs for giant pandas in captivity, and many pandas have been born and raised in zoos and conservation centers worldwide.

It is important to note that giant pandas are a critically endangered species, and conservation efforts are focused on protecting their natural habitats, as well as managing captive populations to ensure their long-term survival. Research on the reproductive behaviors and physiology of giant pandas continues to shed light on their unique reproductive biology and inform conservation strategies for this iconic species.

Q. What are the different weapons in the fight against poaching, and can the battle ever be won?
GT> Poaching continues to be a massive problem for animals like elephants and rhinos, with the demand for their tusks and horns rendering them more expensive than diamonds. But are we going about tackling this in the right way? Simon Hedges works for the Wildlife Conservation Society, and he explained to Kat Arney the double pronged approach needed to save some of our most vulnerable species...

Simon - It is a very significant problem for a whole suite of species across most of the planet, unfortunately. Obviously, we hear about elephants and rhinos particularly and scary statistics like a hundred thousand elephants killed in three years across Africa 2010-2012.  Thousands of rhinos being killed.  We're losing populations and we're losing range of a lot of species and, of course, a lot of species are threatened by poachers to the extent that they actually go extinct in some places.

Kat - In the case of the mountain gorillas, they were being poached for their hands, their feet, their babies were being taken.  In the case of the other species, obviously we get rhinos being poached for their horns, elephants being poached for their ivory.  Is it this kind of medicinal and valuable use that makes people want to poach these animals?

Simon - Very much so in the case of those species with the price of rhino horn more than cocaine or even diamonds, and people can make a tremendous amount of money with very limited investment of time.  Obviously there's a risk, a tremendous risk, they might lose their lives but given how poor some people are across the range of the species, there's a temptation.  But more significantly, I think, it's not just poor people - I think that's a very important point to get across.  What we're increasingly seeing is organised criminal syndicates involved in the poaching and the trafficking of ivory and of rhino horn, and it's the involvement of these groups, particularly, that has led to the crisis we're seeing for elephants and for rhino right now, in the last decade or so.

Kat - This is big stuff if there's organised groups doing it.  How doe we fight it?  What are the ways that some people are trying?

Simon - There are a number of tools in the arsenal if you will. Probably the two key things are to secure the key populations of elephants, rhinos, and all the other species that are affected by poaching in the sites they live in through much more sophisticated and much more people-friendly poaching operations than those you were talking about with the Dian Fossey story, obviously one needs local people on side.  And it's important to recognise that local people are often threatened by these armed poaching gangs  as well.  Their local security, their livelihoods are undermined.  So it's possible to have a win-win situation where anti-poaching operations that are done in a sensitive way and not criminalising the local people, can actually benefit those local people as well as protecting the populations of wildlife we're interested in.

Kat - As well as getting the local population involved, are there any more hi-tech ways that people can try and stop poachers or do we just need better fencing?

Simon - I don't think it's really a question of fencing. Fencing doesn't have a particularly useful role in anti-poaching, I don't think.  Because poachers can easily cut the fences and, indeed, in many places poachers use fencing wire to make snares.  Poaching can be combated through better equipped, better managed, better paid, better motivated rangers whose sacrifice is recognised by the global community.  There are possibilities of using things like drones and other hi-tech tools but, essentially, it does come down to motivated people, properly trained to do the job.

Kat - So those are 'boots on the ground' kind of approaches, but what about just stopping the demand for these products? 

Simon - Yes, absolutely.  Two ends of the trade chain, if you like.  The poaching end and the demand end are the key ends of the trade and, obviously, poachers are trafficking ivory in between but there's many, many routes that contraband can be smuggled.  It's rather like water, it takes the path of least resistance.  So the key thing to do is reduce the demand and reduce the consumption of ivory, and rhino horn, and these other products in the main markets, which for ivory and rhino horn are China and Vietnam and other countries in the far east, to a large degree.

Kat - How can that be done?  I mean if you just say, this is all completely illegal, you shouldn't do it anymore.  Is that the only way we can do it through basically making this stuff illegal?

Simon - Currently, actually, it is legal to trade ivory in many countries around the world in the domestic sense.  There's local markets and it's perfectly legal to go into London and buy ivory, as it is in Beijing or many other countries.  So domestic bans to complement the international ban is definitely part of the jigsaw puzzle and part of the suite of tools we need.  But, if you just ban something, you potentially just push the demand underground, like with prohibition with alcohol.  So what one also needs to do is to actually educate people and effect behavioural change so that the desire to have those products is reduced.  And this has happened before in an number of countries which used to be major players in rhino horn and ivory poaching and consumption are no longer implicated. So we know that demand reduction, consumption can be reduced through a combination of education, awareness raising, and legal approaches.

Kat - We have heard recently that South Africa is considering re-legalising rhino horn.  That would seem to fly in the face wouldn't it - very briefly?

Simon - Yes, international trade remains banned.  South Africa can request, but I think an opening of international trade in rhino horn, I think, is tremendously unlikely to be successful in that request at the CITES meeting (the wildlife trade meeting) in the autumn of this year.  I think most people think that they will be unsuccessful in that request.
ChatGPT> The fight against poaching, which involves the illegal hunting or capturing of wildlife, is a complex and ongoing challenge that requires multifaceted approaches. Some of the different weapons in the fight against poaching include:

Anti-poaching patrols and ranger teams: Deploying well-trained and equipped anti-poaching patrols and ranger teams in protected areas and wildlife habitats can help deter poachers, detect and intercept poaching activities, and apprehend poachers.

Law enforcement and prosecutions: Strengthening law enforcement efforts to detect, arrest, and prosecute poachers can act as a deterrent and create consequences for illegal wildlife trade and poaching. This involves coordinated efforts between local, national, and international law enforcement agencies.

Community engagement and livelihoods: Engaging local communities living in or near wildlife habitats as partners in conservation efforts can help build support for wildlife protection. This can involve providing alternative livelihood options that reduce reliance on poaching, such as ecotourism, sustainable agriculture, and other income-generating activities.

Public awareness and education: Raising public awareness about the negative impacts of poaching on wildlife and ecosystems, as well as the importance of conservation, can help build public support for anti-poaching efforts. Education and outreach programs can also help instill a conservation ethic among local communities, as well as national and international audiences.

Technology and innovation: Advancements in technology, such as drones, cameras, and other surveillance tools, can aid in monitoring and detecting poaching activities, as well as gathering evidence for law enforcement efforts. DNA forensics, data analytics, and other innovative tools can also help track and disrupt illegal wildlife trade networks.

International cooperation and policy interventions: Coordinated efforts among countries and international organizations are crucial in addressing transnational poaching and wildlife trafficking. This involves policy interventions, such as strengthening legislation, trade regulations, and international treaties, as well as collaborative efforts in intelligence sharing, enforcement, and capacity building.

The battle against poaching is challenging and complex, and it is difficult to declare a clear-cut victory. Poaching is driven by various factors, including demand for wildlife products, poverty, lack of alternative livelihoods, and inadequate law enforcement and governance. Achieving long-term success in combating poaching requires sustained efforts addressing these underlying drivers, as well as addressing the complex social, economic, and political dynamics associated with illegal wildlife trade.

Conservation organizations, governments, local communities, law enforcement agencies, and other stakeholders need to work collaboratively, employing a combination of approaches tailored to the specific context and needs of each region or country. This includes addressing the demand for illegal wildlife products, improving livelihood opportunities for local communities, strengthening law enforcement, enhancing public awareness, and fostering international cooperation. Success in the fight against poaching requires a multi-pronged and sustained effort, and continued vigilance is needed to protect wildlife from poaching and illegal trade.

Q. Why saving small populations is a big genetic challenge?
GT> All of the species Kat Arney met in ZSL London Zoo - the blue-crowned laughing thrushes, the Sumatran tigers and the Partula snails - are small groups on the brink of extinction. That poses some significant genetic problems for conservationists, as she discovered when she called up John Ewen, ZSL’s expert on saving small populations.

John - Understanding the genetics of the population of the species is critical when you’re planning for recovery. However, I think what I voiced and what I always encourage others to do if I'm meeting with different groups on conservation problems is take a step back and try and understand first what it is they're trying to achieve.

In most cases when we’re looking at small populations of threatened species, and we’re worried they're facing an extinction event so we’re trying to recover them. So we’ve got this core ‘biological objective’ which is driving our management choices. Then we can start thinking about how genetics plays a role in their recovery.

So, it depends what you want and for me, it’s about recovering populations and recovering a species, and then I start considering how genetics plays a role in that.

Kat - When you do get to the genetic part of it, what sort of things are you thinking about and how do you sort of measure the genetics of a small population?

John - So, I immediately get worried when I'm faced with the situation where we’ve got a small and isolated population because that’s exactly the situation which can get you into trouble from a genetic perspective.

And those types of scenarios, the genetics of those populations will primarily be driven by two processes – one is genetic drifts, so loss of genetic diversity, then a second problem around inbreeding, so breeding between relatives. And both of those things will change the genetic constitution of their population.

When that happens, you can run into problems. So the two main problems that happen will be the risk of inbreeding depression and also, the lack of ability for these populations to adapt in the future.

Kat - What do you mean by inbreeding depression? Presumably, they're not just sitting around going, “I'm so depressed. All I've got are my cousins left.”

John - No. I mean, we start talking about inbreeding depression we’re starting to link the genetic effects on fitness. By fitness, I’m starting to look at those demographic parameters which are important for a population to persist. So, we have things like impacts on reproduction, impacts on survival and susceptibility to diseases, and other stresses from the environment on that species.

Kat - Is there any point when you're looking at a population that genetically speaking, they are just gone, they're too far gone, there's no way you can get them back?

John - No. I don’t believe that at all. I think that adds a separate challenge that we then have to deal with. So then we start talking in my world about recovery and how we might want to try and manage recovery, linking in with genetics then we want to try and recover some of the genetic diversity.

So there are options in how you might go about doing that and it really depends again on what your overarching objectives are to the management of that population. At the most basic level, we know that diversity arises because of mutation and that this process requires large population sizes.

So, in any case, I would be trying to grow my threatened population to as big as the population size as possible and as quickly as possible so I can remove any further loss of diversity through this random process of drift and I can create a situation where more diversity can arise through mutation.

Kat - So you're basically trying to grow some weird mutants to boost your population?

John - Well, not trying to purposely grow something like a weird mutant. This is what natural populations do. This is how genetic diversity arises. So, we’re just trying to put that population back in a place where nature can do its work.

Kat - What are your hopes for conservation in the future? What really needs to happen to make a difference and to save these species that do seem to be going extinct at an incredible rate?

John - Well for me, I'm actually much more of an optimist than a pessimist and I think the tools that we are using currently to recover threatened species, they can work and we need much more investment in them, and genetics certainly is an important component of that an informs them.

And so, with this increasing technology that we have and with dedicated people, we can bring species back from the brink of extinction. It works and there's evidence out there that works. So, we just need to do more of it.

Kat - John Ewen, from ZSL. 
ChatGPT> Saving small populations of endangered species can present significant genetic challenges due to a phenomenon known as genetic drift. Genetic drift refers to the random changes in gene frequencies that can occur in small populations due to chance events, such as genetic mutations, genetic recombination, and changes in population size. In small populations, genetic drift can have a more pronounced effect because there are fewer individuals to contribute genetic diversity and buffer against genetic changes.

When a population becomes small, it may experience a loss of genetic diversity and reduced genetic variation, which can lead to inbreeding, increased inbreeding depression, and reduced adaptive potential. Inbreeding depression refers to the reduction in fitness or reproductive success of individuals in a population due to increased expression of harmful genetic traits resulting from mating between close relatives. Reduced adaptive potential means that the population may have less genetic diversity to adapt to changing environmental conditions, such as climate change or habitat loss.

Small populations are also more vulnerable to genetic factors that can impact their long-term survival. For example, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, genetic diseases, and loss of genetic adaptations can occur in small populations over time, reducing their fitness and viability. Additionally, genetic factors can interact with other threats to small populations, such as habitat loss, disease, and climate change, further exacerbating their vulnerability.

Conservation efforts for small populations often involve strategies to minimize the negative effects of genetic drift and maximize genetic diversity. This can include techniques such as genetic rescue, where individuals from different populations or subspecies are translocated to small populations to increase genetic diversity, and captive breeding programs that carefully manage breeding pairs to avoid inbreeding. Genetic monitoring, genetic testing, and population modeling can also be used to assess the genetic health and viability of small populations and guide conservation management decisions.

In summary, saving small populations of endangered species is a big genetic challenge because they are more susceptible to genetic drift, inbreeding, reduced genetic diversity, and loss of adaptive potential. Careful genetic management and conservation strategies are crucial to mitigate these challenges and ensure the long-term survival and genetic health of small populations.
