Sexhow railway station,History,"The station was opened in April 1857, when the line from Picton was opened up as far as Stokesley. Mapping shows the station to have had three sidings in the goods yard, coal drops and a crane. The main station buildings were on the westbound (Picton direction) side of the station. The station was south of the village that it served, and was actually in the parish of Carlton in Cleveland, which has led to speculation that it was named Sexhow to avoid confusion with Redmarshall railway station, which was originally named Carlton.Bradshaw's timetable of 1877 shows five out and back workings between Stockton railway station and Whitby, with connections advertised in Middlesbrough. The timetable of 1906 shows that the station had six services eastbound from Stockton railway station towards Stokesley, with five going all the way to Whitby and one terminating at Battersby railway station. Return services were just five a day with four coming from Whitby. The other service from Whitby reversed at Battersby and went to Stockton via Middlesbrough railway station. By 1946, eight years before closure, the service was down to just three stopping services each way per day, with most of the services from Whitby to Stockton reversing at Battersby and going via Middlesbrough.The station closed to passengers in June 1954, and then closed completely in December 1958, having been used for goods traffic."

Etiäinen,Possible causes,"One explanation given for the detail of the apparition is that when a person is waiting for someone, their anticipation can augment everyday sounds, for example of a cat or the wind, and bring to consciousness a vivid recollection of the person. This recollection will tend to produce the feeling that the remembered person is ""coming"". If no one comes, the ""possible etiäinen"" is forgotten. The failure of this explanation is that etiäinen is not necessary when you expect someone to come. It more often indicates an unexpected visitor who would otherwise come as a surprise without phone calls or any kind of announcement beforehand."

        f

        (
        a

    {\displaystyle b=f(a)}
   is the inverse map of

          f
          
            −

    {\displaystyle Jf^{-1}(b)=Jf(a)^{-1}.}
  The hard part of the theorem is the existence and differentiability of 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{-1}}
  . Assuming this, the inverse derivative formula follows from the chain rule applied to 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            −
            1
          
        
        ∘
        f
        =
        I
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{-1}\circ f=I}
  . (Indeed, 
  
    
      
        I
        =
        (

            1
          
        
        ∘
        f
        
          )
          
            
              
              ′
            
          
        
        (
        a
        )
        =
        (
        
          f
          
            −
            1

        )
        ∘
        
          f
          ′
        
        (
        a
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle I=(f^{-1}\circ f)^{'}(a)=(f^{-1})'(b)\circ f'(a).}
  ) Since taking the inverse is infinitely differentiable, the formula for the derivative of the inverse shows that if 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is continuously 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   times differentiable, with invertible derivative at the point a, then the inverse is also continuously 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   times differentiable. Here 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   is a positive integer or

There are two variants of the inverse function theorem. Given a continuously differentiable map

Inverse function theorem,Methods of proof,"As an important result, the inverse function theorem has been given numerous proofs. The proof most commonly seen in textbooks relies on the contraction mapping principle, also known as the Banach fixed-point theorem (which can also be used as the key step in the proof of existence and uniqueness of solutions to ordinary differential equations).Since the fixed point theorem applies in infinite-dimensional (Banach space) settings, this proof generalizes immediately to the infinite-dimensional version of the inverse function theorem (see Generalizations below).
An alternate proof in finite dimensions hinges on the extreme value theorem for functions on a compact set.Yet another proof uses Newton's method, which has the advantage of providing an effective version of the theorem: bounds on the derivative of the function imply an estimate of the size of the neighborhood on which the function is invertible."

The proof above is presented for a finite-dimensional space, but applies equally well for Banach spaces.  If an invertible function 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is Ck with 
  
    
      
        k
        >
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle k>1}
  , then so too is its inverse. This follows by induction using the fact that the map 
  
    
      
        F
        (
        A
        )
        =
        
          A
          
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F(A)=A^{-1}}
   on operators is Ck for any 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   (in the finite-dimensional case this is an elementary fact because the inverse of a matrix is given as the adjugate matrix divided by its determinant).
 The method of proof here can be found in the books of Henri Cartan, Jean Dieudonné, Serge Lang, Roger Godement and Lars Hörmander."
Inverse function theorem,A proof using the contraction mapping principle,"Here is a proof based on the contraction mapping theorem. Specifically, following T. Tao, it uses the following consequence of the contraction mapping theorem.

Basically, the lemma says that a small perturbation of the identity map by a contraction map is injective and preserves a ball in some sense. Assuming the lemma for a moment, we prove the theorem first. As in the above proof, it is enough to prove the special case when

        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is differentiable at

    {\displaystyle y}

It remains to show the lemma. First, the map 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is injective on 
  
    
      
        B
        (
        0
        ,
        r
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle B(0,r)}
   since if 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        f
        (
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)=f(y)}
  , then 
  
    
      
        g
        (
        y
        )
        −
        g
        (
        x
        )
        =
        x
        −
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle g(y)-g(x)=x-y}
   and so

  
    
      
        
          |
        
        g
        (
        y
        )
        −
        g
        (
        x
        )
        
          |
        
        =
        
          |
        
        y
        −
        x
        
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |g(y)-g(x)|=|y-x|}
  ,which is a contradiction unless 
  
    
      
        y
        =
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle y=x}
  . (This part does not need the assumption 
  
    
      
        g
        (
        0
        )
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle g(0)=0}
  .) Next we show 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        B
        (
        0
        ,
        r
        )
        )
        ⊃
        B
        (
        0
        ,
        (
        1
        −

        r
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(B(0,r))\supset B(0,(1-c)r)}
  . The idea is to note that this is equivalent to, given a point 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   in 
  
    
      
        B
        (
        0
        ,

        −
        c
        )
        r
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle B(0,(1-c)r)}
  , find a fixed point of the map

        g
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle F:{\overline {B}}(0,r')\to {\overline {B}}(0,r'),\,x\mapsto y-g(x)}
  where

    {\displaystyle 0<r'<r}
   such that 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        y
        
          |
        
        ≤
        (

          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |y|\leq (1-c)r'}
   and the bar means a closed ball. To find a fixed point, we use the contraction mapping theorem and checking that 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
   is a well-defined strict-contraction mapping is straightforward. Finally, we have: 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        B
        (
        0

        )
        )
        ⊂
        B
        (
        0
        ,
        (

        +
        c
        )
        r
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(B(0,r))\subset B(0,(1+c)r)}
   since

  
    
      
        
          |
        
        f

  As might be clear, this proof is not substantially different from the previous one, as the proof of the contraction mapping theorem is by successive approximation."

        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   gives a local parametrization of

        E

Inverse function theorem,Global version,"The inverse function theorem is a local result; it applies to each point. A priori, the theorem thus only shows the function 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is locally bijective (or locally diffeomorphic of some class). The next topological lemma can be used to upgrade local injectivity to injectivity that is global to some extent.

Proof: First assume 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is compact. If the conclusion of the theorem is false, we can find two sequences 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        ≠
        
          y
          
            i

   such that 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        )
        =
        f
        (
        
          y
          
            i
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x_{i})=f(y_{i})}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            i

   in 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  . Since 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is injective on 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  , 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=y}
  . Now, if 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
   is large enough,

            i
          
        
        ,
        
          y
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{i},y_{i}}
   are in a neighborhood of 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=y}
   where 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is injective; thus, 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        =
        
          y
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{i}=y_{i}}
  , a contradiction.
In general, consider the set

        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle E=\{(x,y)\in X^{2}\mid x\neq y,f(x)=f(y)\}}
  . It is disjoint from 
  
    
      
        S
        ×
        S

        S

        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
  , we can find a neighborhood 
  
    
      
        
          U

    {\displaystyle A\cap X_{i}}
   such that 
  
    
      
        
          U

The lemma implies the following (a sort of) global version of the inverse function theorem:

Note that if 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   is a point, then the above is the usual inverse function theorem."
Inverse function theorem,Holomorphic inverse function theorem,"There is a version of the inverse function theorem for holomorphic maps.

        (
        x
        )

If the derivative of F is an isomorphism at all points p in M then the map F is a local diffeomorphism."

        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}

When the derivative of F is injective (resp. surjective) at a point p, it is also injective (resp. surjective) in a neighborhood of p, and hence the rank of F is constant on that neighborhood, and the constant rank theorem applies."
Inverse function theorem,Polynomial functions,"If it is true, the Jacobian conjecture would be a variant of the inverse function theorem for polynomials. It states that if a vector-valued polynomial function has a Jacobian determinant that is an invertible polynomial (that is a nonzero constant), then it has an inverse that is also a polynomial function. It is unknown whether this is true or false, even in the case of two variables. This is a major open problem in the theory of polynomials."

Stepping on Roses,Plot,"During the year Meiji 25 (1892,) Sumi Kitamura is penniless and her brother Eisuke, a womanizer and gambler, constantly leaves them in debt while bringing even more orphaned children home to feed. When her adopted sister, Tomi, becomes ill, Sumi finds that no doctors will help her as they are poor and no one is willing to give her money for medicine to save Tomi. Then as Sumi is crying on the road a handsome man gives her a handkerchief and some money, telling her to stop crying as smiles beckon happiness into her life before disappearing. Later a debt collector turns up at Sumi's house demanding 2000 yen. Eisuke is nowhere to be found and it is revealed that he had been making advances on the debt collector's wife. The man says that he will take away all of Sumi's younger siblings and sell them into slavery. Desperate to save her siblings, Sumi goes to the red light district in an attempt to raise the money in one night. Just when she thinks there's no more hope, a man named Soichiro Ashida appears and says that he will buy her. Sumi goes with him only to find that he was paying her to marry him! They immediately go to the church and afterwards he says that he'll pay for anything she could possibly want, but she has to marry him and not fall for him and that he will never love her. Sumi agrees and they get married."
Stepping on Roses,Characters,"Sumi Ashida (née Kitamura) (北村 純, Kitamura Sumi)

Sumi's husband; He marries Sumi to get his inheritance. He is a childhood friend of Nozomu. He can be considered an example of a tsundere character. Soichiro is afraid of fires due to a traumatic event in his childhood, where his parents and younger half-brother died in a fire that destroyed his home. Some believe that it was Soichiro who caused this tragedy, when it was likely his half-brother's doing, as he had been playing with matches earlier that day. Soichiro is quick to assume and can be selfish, but seems to be learning to genuinely care for Sumi. He falls in love with her, even giving up all his money and his company to be with her. Sumi has changed him for a better person. At the end of the story, Soichiro and Sumi have a baby girl.Nozomu Ijuin (伊集院 望, Ijūin Nozomu)
Soichiro's childhood friend. He is very skilled at painting. He falls in love with Sumi, the moment he sees her. But it evolves into an obsession when it's brought to his attention that he can't have her. He even goes as far as kidnapping her. Despite later being married to Miu, a woman of his father's choosing, he asks Sumi to run away with him. He becomes a yandere character as the story progresses. Nozomu is conniving enough to attain the presidencies of both his father's and Soichiro's companies. Later on, he even forces an eviction on Sumi's adopted family, and makes them homeless, in order to make Sumi come to him for help and love him. However, deep down inside, Sumi still has feelings and love for Soichiro, no matter how hard that Nozomu forces on her. Despite finding out that Sumi is his biological sister, he still wanted to marry her. When Soichiro came and stopped the wedding by taking Sumi away, since she loves him the most, Nozomu makes up with Miu and starts loving her. In the end of the story, Nozomu and Miu are off far away from where Sumi is, so Nozomu can try to forget his love for her, as she is his sister, and he and Miu are expecting a baby soon.Gengoro Komai (駒井 源五郎, Komai Gengorō)

In the end of the story, Komai is Soichiro and Sumi's butler again.Eisuke Kitamura (北村 英輔, Kitamura Eisuke)
Sumi's older brother, who has a terrible problem with gambling. Eisuke gets a job at Soichiro's company and manages to pay 10 years worth of the bills towards his landlord.

It is revealed that Sumi and Eisuke are not biologically related; he found her in a rose garden as a baby and brought her up as his sister. The reason Eisuke brings home so many abandoned children to Sumi because she once wished for more siblings. In the end of the story, Eisuke is seen holding Soichiro and Sumi's baby daughter in one of his arms.Miu Ijuin (née Fujiwara) (伊集院 美卯, Ijūin Miu)
Nozomu's wife from an arranged marriage by their parents. She is devoted to Nozomu but he is unfeeling towards her. She is good friends with Sumi at first. Because she had not know of Sumi and Nozomu's previous relationship, she didn't know about Nozomu's psychotic tendencies either. She tries to get Nozomu to notice her, going so far as to use Sumi's perfume. This causes Nozomu to react physically with Miu for the first time in their arranged marriage. Unfortunately, he whispers Sumi's name, not Miu's. Miu starts to wonder what relationship the two had before her marriage to Nozomu. At a party, Nozomu continues to fawn and look at Sumi lovingly. He praises her saying she was more beautiful than anyone else. Before dancing with her, Nozomu refers to Sumi by her name, which causes Miu to flash back to Nozomu whispering Sumi's name. Miu grabs a bouquet of roses and attacks Sumi, cutting her cheek with the thorns, and cries hysterically. After the attack on Sumi, Miu confronts Nozomu and asks if he is in love with that aforementioned girl, to which Nozomu admits that he is and that he does not feel the same way about her. Miu then finds Nozomu's painting of Sumi, and slashes it with a knife. Later, Miu arrives suddenly at the shogi club and informs everyone that she will be holding a party at her and Nozomu's. During this party, Nozomu unexpectedly announces to all the guests that he and Miu will be divorcing, without consulting with Miu beforehand. Devastated, she yells at Sumi and blames her for all that has happened. She attempts to stab Sumi in rage, but is stopped by Soichiro and Nozomu, and once again cries uncontrollably. She enters a coma-like state and is sent to a summer house for patients with mental health problems. Sumi visits her, begging to know what she must do to atone for her friend's misfortune, and she tells Sumi to jump off a cliff into the ocean. Sumi then does so, because she greatly cares for Miu. It is then implied that her and Sumi's friendship is restored, with Miu understanding that it was always Nozomu who'd been chasing Sumi. In the end of the story, Miu and Nozomu make up, go off far away place in the country, and are expecting a baby soon.Natsuki Kujo (九条 夏樹, Kujō Natsuki)
Soichiro’s step-cousin and vice-president of Soichiro's company. He becomes suspicious of Sumi and attempts to find out her true origins. He and Nozomu later team up to have Soichiro removed as company president. It is implied that he had held real feelings for Keiko, but made her doubt him when he tells her he was to be married soon. He was tricked by Nozomu who takes the head position from him. He later return to Sumi's side to aide her for redemption. In the end of the story, he was one of the fellows from Soichiro's company that congratulated Sumi for establishing an elementary school, thus making him nice.Keiko Kinoshita (木下 桂子, Kinoshita Keiko)
Soichiro and Sumi’s maid. She appears to be loyal and friendly, but is actually working as a spy for Natsuki. It is implied that she and Natsuki had a physical relationship, one she hoped to hold onto even after she went to spy on Soichiro. In the later chapters, she returns to Natsuki's house.  There, Natsuki proposes to Keiko but she refuses, saying she was discarded. It was hinted that he did have feelings for her. But after Keiko realizes that all Natsuki wanted was power, she cuts off all ties with him. After her confrontation with Natsuki, she is kinder to Sumi, and stops making advances towards Soichiro."

Stepping on Roses,Volume list,
Stepping on Roses,Light Novel,"The series is also being adapted as a light novel, that runs in Cobalt."
Stepping on Roses,Reception,"Deb Aoki of About.com says of the first volume that while it glosses over its Meiji Era setting's ""not-so-pretty aspects"", the approach works for what Ueda is doing. Overall, Aoki seems to like the series, calling it a ""charming and unapologetically romantic story that will make you smile."" Mania.com's Julie Opipari mentions that while the series is like a Harlequin novel, which could be off-putting for some readers, it drew her into the story. She also mentions that occasionally the melodrama is a bit much, but that she ""can't wait to find out"" what will happen next.Volume two of the Viz edition of the manga was number 10 on the New York Times manga best-seller list in its first week of release. The third and fourth volumes were ranked number 8 on the same list in their first week of release. The fifth volume of the Viz's English release of the series ranked 6th in its first week of publication."

Upon graduating from law school, he worked as an assistant state attorney in the Fourth Judicial Circuit of Florida until 1998, and then worked as a special magistrate for Green Cove Springs. In 2007, Bradley was appointed to the Clay County Commission by then-Governor Charlie Crist following the resignation of previous County Commissioner John E. Thrasher.

From 2009 to 2012, he served on the St. Johns River State College Board of Trustees, and currently works as the managing partner of Kopelousos, Bradley & Garrison, P.A., a law firm in Orange Park, Florida."
Rob Bradley,Florida Senate,"When the state's legislative districts were redrawn in 2012, Bradley opted to run in the newly created 7th District, and won the Republican primary unopposed. Advancing to the general election, he was opposed by Will Mazzota, the Democratic nominee and a University of Florida student who had his filing fee paid for by the Florida Democratic Party. Though the race was built up as a ""Clay-vs.-Alachua County race,"" Bradley ended up defeating Mazzota with ease, winning 58% of the vote to Mazzota's 42%. In hindsight, Mazzota noted, ""I think I put as much effort into it as I could have as a student and I'm proud of what I did,"" and Bradley pledged to focus on creating jobs and improving education in the legislature.During the 2014 legislative session, Bradley was one of the three main Senate sponsors of legislation that allowed ""severely epileptic children to seek relief legally by ingesting nonsmokable, low-THC medical marijuana."" He noted that although he was opposed to legalizing marijuana, he was fully committed to helping ""the desperate parents"" of the children who have tried everything else.After court-ordered redistricting, Bradley was redistricted in 2016 to the reconfigured 5th district. He was elected to that district, which encompasses Baker, Bradford, Clay, Columbia, Dixie, Gilchrist, Lafayette, Levy, Suwannee, and Union Counties, and part of western Marion County."

Moluccans,History,"The indigenous inhabitants of the Maluku Islands are Melanesian in origin and have been aboriginal to the Maluku archipelago dating back at least 30.000 BCE. However, due to later Austronesian migration waves from around 5000 - 2000 BCE, genetic studies detail the presence of varying levels of Austronesian mitochondrial DNA in populations on different islands in Maluku. Whereas paternal genetic structure remains predominantly Melanesian in its make-up within the region. This explains a primarily maternal Austronesian influence on the Melanesian population that influenced the development of typical socio-linguistic elements and other areas within the Moluccan culture, making Malayo-Polynesian languages dominating in most of the region, with the exception of some areas where languages belonging to the West Papuan language group are still prevalent. Later added to this were several Dutch, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabian and English influences, due to colonization, intermarriage with foreign traders during the Silk-route era and Middle Ages, and even with European soldiers during the World Wars. A small number of German descendants was added to Moluccan population, especially in Ambon, along with arrival of Protestant Missionaries since 16th century.After the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies during World War II, the Netherlands wanted to restore the old colonial situation. The indigenous Indonesians were against it. However, led by rebels and Sukarno, a struggle for independence broke out between 1945 and 1950. The reconstituted Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) was commissioned by the Dutch government to maintain order and to disarm the rebels. Moluccan professional soldiers formed an important part of this army. The Moluccan community was thus regarded by the Dutch as allies and vice versa. The government of the Netherlands had promised the Moluccans that they would get their own free state and independence back in return for assisting the Netherlands. After international efforts could not support the Netherlands to maintain its colony, the Dutch government chose to no longer keep its promise to the Moluccans of an independent state. The Moluccans, who were seen by the Indonesians as collaborators with the Dutch, were given two options, to demobilize the military force and ""temporarily"" go to the Netherlands before returning to an independent Maluku, or assimilate and take on the Indonesian nationality. Most Moluccans who served in the command of KNIL would reside temporarily in the Netherlands. The Moluccans were instead discharged from military service shortly after arriving, and housed in repurposed WWII concentration camps in the Netherlands, including the former Westerbork transit camp. Where they were isolated from Dutch society and held under extremely poor living conditions for years.The Dutch Moluccans had repeatedly drawn the attention of the Dutch government to their claim for a free Republic of South Maluku (Republik Maluku Selatan or RMS) state, which the Dutch government had promised them. However, the situation began to escalate as RMS's struggle gained notoriety in the 1970s when demonstrations and violence propelled it into the Dutch public eye. Finally, after still being ignored and denied a hearing by the government, one of the methods to gain attention on the matter was through the hijackings of 1975 Dutch train hostage crisis in De Punt, Wijster, where hostages were taken, and the members were killed."
Moluccans,Language,"The Moluccans speak over a hundred different languages, with a majority of them belonging to the Central Malayo-Polynesian language family. An important exception is the North Moluccan islands which include the island of Halmahera and its surrounding islands, where the majority of the population speak West Papuan languages (North Halmahera branch), possibly brought through historical migration from the Bird's Head Peninsula of New Guinea. Another exception are the Malay-based creoles such as the Ambonese language (also known as Ambonese Malay), spoken mainly on Ambon and the nearby Ceram; and North Moluccan Malay used on the islands of Ternate, Tidore, Halmahera and Sula Islands in North Maluku. Moluccans living in the Netherlands mostly speak Ambonese and Buru, as well as the national and official Dutch language."
Moluccans,Religion,"The Moluccans in the northern Moluccas (present province of North Maluku) are mainly Muslim. and the Moluccans in the central and South Moluccas (present day Maluku) are mainly Christians.The religions that are most often espoused by Moluccans in the Netherlands are the Protestant faith and, to a lesser extent, Islam.
There are significant number of native Hindu followers in Kei Islands although the region is predominantly Catholic, despite the Maluku province's overall Christian population are Protestant."

Pussy Fairy (OTW),Background and release,"Jhené Aiko co-wrote ""Pussy Fairy (OTW)"" with Julian-Quán Việt Lê and Micah Powell. Việt Lê produced the song, recording it on a reference microphone. Việt Lê, Christian Plata, Zeke Mishanec and Fisticuffs were the audio engineers, and were assisted by Andy Guerrero and Trey Pearce. Gregg Rominiecki handled the track's audio mixing.Def Jam released ""Pussy Fairy (OTW)"" on January 16, 2020 as the third single from Aiko's third studio album, Chilombo. The song was made available for digital download and streaming. To promote it, Aiko sold a capsule collection of two types of hoodies and t-shirts through her website. Having a pink and white color scheme, the clothing had a cartoon picture of a cat dressed as a fairy alongside the single's title. A digital copy of the album was paired with each item. In a February 2020 article for HotNewHipHop, Mitch Findlay was uncertain if ""Pussy Fairy (OTW)"" would be included on Chilombo. However, Aiko confirmed its inclusion after unveiling the album's track listing later that month. The single is 3:01 long; on the album, it is extended to 3:41.On February 21, 2020, Aiko released a ""super clean"" version of ""Pussy Fairy (OTW)"", which has less explicit lyrics. A music video, in which Aiko appears as a fairy in a forest on the Big Island, was made available on the same day. Prior to the video's release, she posted images of herself in the fairy costume on Instagram. Aiko announced on May 29, 2020, that she would release a new version of ""Pussy Fairy (OTW)"" with a longer intro on a deluxe edition of Chilombo, however, the song was the same length on the deluxe edition Def Jam released on July 17, 2020."
Pussy Fairy (OTW),Music and lyrics,"""Pussy Fairy (OTW)"" is an R&B ballad written in the key of D major, incorporating an alchemy crystal sound bowl. This instrument is featured throughout Chilombo, often used to produce a single background note. Aiko chose the key of D major for ""Pussy Fairy (OTW)"" to spark the listener's Svadhishthana, a chakra associated with ""pleasure and intimacy""; she described the intended response as similar to ""activating your...balls and your ovaries"". Aiko was introduced to sound bowls during sound therapy, and had used them in a 2019 meditation video entitled Trigger Protection Mantra. Along with the sound bowl, the song's composition  includes a ""bass-boosted intro"". In a Vulture article, Halle Kiefer referred to the song's tone as ""extremely mellow"", and The Guardian's Laura Snapes said it had a ""visceral fricative beat"".The single is about sexuality; Aiko sings about her ""bedroom skills"", and acts as the ""pussy fairy"" in the title. In a Noisey article, Kristin Corry summarized the song's message as a ""lesson in seduction"". On its release, media outlets noted its sexually explicit content, which some writers dubbed not safe for work. Nalae Anais White, writing for The Fader, described the single as  ""boldly sensual"" and ""vaguely chaotic"". The sensual focus was a departure from the ""fiery post-breakup energy"" of Chilombo's previous singles, ""Triggered (Freestyle)"" and ""None of Your Concern"", both released in 2019.In a review of Chilombo, Stephen Kearse of Pitchfork interpreted its first six tracks, including ""Pussy Fairy (OTW)"", as narrating a story about ""a woman enduring heartbreak and emerging stronger"". MTV News' Trey Alston wrote that the song was part of a larger theme in Aiko's music that features her singing about ""how sex ties us all together and strengthens some emotions while weakening others"". ""Pussy Fairy (OTW)"" is referenced in ""On The Way"", a track added to the album's deluxe edition.Hypebeast's Sophie Caraan characterized ""Pussy Fairy (OTW)""'s lyrics as ""no-holds-barred"". Aiko brags about her sexual performance, ""I know you love fucking me"", and she sings, ""that dick make me so proud"", to make the listener question ""who is giving and receiving pleasure"". In a Revolt article, Tamantha Gunn remarked that Aiko acts ""all types of freaky"" by singing the chorus: ""Don’t be surprised boy, when I buss it wide / I hypnotize you with this pussy / Now you feel like you can fly."" Reviewers believed the song was about Aiko's ex-boyfriend, Big Sean. HotNewHipHop's Lynn S. identified the line ""that dick make my soul smile"" as being directed toward him. Uproxx's Carolyn Droke said the lyrics, ""I got you sprung off in the spring time / Fuck all your free time / You don’t need no me time / That’s you and me time"", were about intimacy with a partner, while White believed they were about being overly possessive in a relationship."
Pussy Fairy (OTW),Critical reception,"""Pussy Fairy (OTW)"" was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Billboard's Carl Lamarre praised it as the ""punchiest and most provocative track"" from Chilombo. In a review of the album for Exclaim!, Ryan B. Patrick said the song is ""catchy and ribald as all get out"" and selected it as one of the highlights. A contributor for HipHopDX wrote that ""Triggered (Freestyle)"" and ""Pussy Fairy (OTW)"" had set high expectations before the album's release. While praising Aiko's vocals, Entertainment Weekly's Marcus Jones described ""Pussy Fairy (OTW)"" as a ""siren call hypnotizing lovers into sauntering right back into the bedroom for an extended holiday break"". Glamour and Rolling Stone ranked ""Pussy Fairy OTW"" as one of the best songs of 2020.Some critics praised the song for its sexually explicit lyrics, which Vibe's Candace McDuffie described as showing Aiko ""relishing in the power of her own anatomy"". Trey Alston commended the lyrics as ""so particular and direct that you can't help but want to follow her every order"". Joi-Marie McKenzie of Essence cited ""Pussy Fairy (OTW)"" as an example of how Aiko's focus on vibrational healing on Chilombo resonates without being ""too hippy-dippy"". In an April 2020 article for Elle, Nerisha Penrose named ""Pussy Fairy (OTW)"" one of the top 24 songs of the year to date. Penrose enjoyed the focus on the sacral chakra since it added depth to the sexual content. Praising the song as an album highlight, Laura Snapes summed it up as an ""unapologetic demand for pleasure and rejection of judgment"". Stephen Kearse enjoyed ""Pussy Fairy (OTW)"", but criticized Aiko for acting too ""coy and inert"" in the follow-up track ""Happiness Over Everything (H.O.E.)"" despite calling herself the ""pussy fairy"".Vulture's Craig Jenkins compared ""Pussy Fairy (OTW)""'s sexual content with 1990s songs like  Bell Biv DeVoe's ""Do Me!"" and Silk's ""Freak Me"". He felt ""Pussy Fairy (OTW)"", Tinashe's ""So Much Better"" (2019) and Summer Walker's ""Girls Need Love"" (2018), showed R&B singers being ""very upfront about sensuality and desire"". In Vice, Kristin Corry said Aiko made ""her own playful version of a bedroom jam"", but remarked that it was not as explicit as Janet Jackson's 1997 album The Velvet Rope."
Pussy Fairy (OTW),Commercial performance,"According to a 2020 Uproxx article, ""Pussy Fairy (OTW)"" was ""heavily popular"". It peaked at number 40 on the US Billboard Hot 100 on March 21, 2020, and remained on the chart for 25 weeks. The song was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of 500,000 units.Twelve of Chilombo's tracks appeared on the Billboard Hot R&B Songs chart, including ""Pussy Fairy (OTW)"" which appeared at number five.

Pussy Fairy (OTW),Music video,"Brandon Parker directed the song's music video, which was released on January 16, 2020, in North Hollywood. In it, Aiko dances with a man in a dance studio that has purple lighting. She uploaded an instructional video to her YouTube channel to break down the music video's dance moves for viewers. She also released a video that included trivia about the song, its music video, and her personal life. In an Uproxx article, Aaron Williams likened the concept of Aiko's video to the television show Pop-Up Video.The song and music video received a positive response on Twitter, and Aiko became a trending topic. Critics noted that the video was not as explicit as the lyrics, although The Fader's Sajae Elder remarked that it was ""still somehow a perfect match for the song's sexy subject matter"". Carolyn Droke described the visual as ""hypnotizing"" and ""intimately choreographed"". Halle Kiefer compared its warehouse set and Aiko's wardrobe to the music videos for Aaliyah's songs ""One in a Million"" (1996) and ""Are You That Somebody?"" (1998)."

Somewhere Somehow (album),Background,"Following the release of Sunshine State of Mind (2011), bassist Drew Thomsen left We the Kings, citing exhaustion from touring. The band recruited Charles Trippy to replace Thomsen and brought in keyboardist Coley O'Toole, both of whom the band knew from the Bradenton music scene. The band toured throughout 2012, leaving them little time to compose new material. Vocalist/guitarist Travis Clark managed to write one new song during the Christmas break, ""Just Keep Breathing"". The group parted ways with their previous record label S-Curve in 2013.After consulting their manager, Bret Disend, We the Kings released ""Just Keep Breathing"" as a single on April 5, 2013. Considered a success by Broadway World, the song would go on to sell over 149,000 copies in one month. Following this up a month later, the group released ""Find You There"" on May 5. It would go on to sell 93,000 copies. By this point, the band had four songs demoed. A month later, the band released ""Any Other Way"" on June 15. In July and August, the band went on the Summer Fest tour, with support from Breathe Carolina, The Ready Set and T. Mills."
Somewhere Somehow (album),Composition,"Clark said the freedom of working without a label ""lent a sense of relaxation to the [writing] process and a stress-free environment."" Not wishing to write the same album twice, Clark explained that the band ""wanted [the new album] to feel 'groovy'"", so he spent more time composing the songs. The album's sound has been described as pop by professional reviewers. According to Clark, ""Find You There"" is about ""find[ing] that one special person/or thing that gives [someone] their life purpose."" ""Art of War"" was written for inclusion on The Hunger Games soundtrack (2012), but was left off. ""Just Keep Breathing"" is about being bullied as child for having red hair.Clark co-wrote every song on the album with outside writers. ""Queen of Hearts"", ""That Feeling"", and ""Phoenix Hearts"" were co-written with Steve Shebby. ""Find You There"", ""I Feel Alive"", ""I Like It"", ""See You in My Dreams"", and ""Say It Now"" were co-written with Blake Healy. ""Die Young Live Forever"" was co-written with Healy and Ryan Daly. ""Any Other Way"" was co-written with Healy and Fransisca Hall. ""Art of War"" was co-written with Healy, Kevin Bard, Taylor Clark, and Dylan Quagliato. ""Sad Song"" was co-written with Bard and David Immerman, and ""Just Keep Breathing"" was co-written with Healy and Bard."
Somewhere Somehow (album),Production,"We the Kings planned to release one single per month but they grew impatient. They decided to dedicate two months of studio time to writing a new album. On September 26, 2013, We the Kings set up a crowd-funding campaign on the website IndieGoGo to record a new album with a target goal of $35,000. The band offered 12 perks to fans who could receive rewards for their contribution such as a ""Thank You"" in the album's credits section, or spending a day in the studio. While the campaign ran for 30 days, the goal was met within 24 hours. The group received $67,000 in a matter of two days and eventually received at total of $149,483 from 2,309 contributors. Initially, the group thought that this figure was an error. After being contacted, IndieGoGo confirmed the amount was correct. Clark commented that their fans ""can expect this to be the best album we've ever made, because there are no strings attached. We are the ones deciding everything about this album and with your help we can truly make the best WTK album yet.""Recording took place in Los Angeles, California. All of the album's songs except for ""Queen of Hearts"", ""That Feeling"", ""Phoenix Hearts"", and ""Sad Song"" were produced by Blake Healy and Clark. ""Queen of Hearts"", ""That Feeling"" and ""Phoenix Hearts"" were produced by Steve Shebby and Clark. ""Sad Song"" was produced by David Immerman, Shebby, and Clark. Joe Bucci performed additional drums on ""Queen of Hearts"". ""Die Young Live Forever"" features guitar parts by Jose Carreon of TheKingsMen, who had contributed enough money to the IndieGoGo project to allow him to record with the band. ""Sad Song"" features guest vocals by singer-songwriter Elena Coats. Mixing was done by Jeff Julliano at Fused, located in Harbeson, Delaware. Additional editing was done by Garrett Davi. The album was mastered by Brad Blackwood at Euphoric Mastering."

Somewhere Somehow (album),Reception,
Somewhere Somehow (album),Critical response,"AllMusic reviewer Mark Deming called the album a ""polished, heartfelt set of contemporary pop"" with the group's ""most accessible work to date."" Reviewing the album for Newsday, Glenn Gamboa called it the group's ""best album yet"", complete with ""strong pop hooks and pristine production."" Gamboa noted that the band was continually improving their ""sound, making everything catchier and harder-hitting."" Marcus Clark of SoSoActive called the ""over produced pop"" backing tracks ""decent but I just can't [enjoy] it."" Referring to the album as ""pop garbage with no kind of appeal"", he was unsure why the album was as popular as it was."
Somewhere Somehow (album),Commercial performance and legacy,"Somewhere Somehow sold more copies on its release than the group's previous three albums, debuting at number 44 on the Billboard 200.

In the UK, the album charted at number 88 on the Albums Chart, number 17 on the Downloads Chart, number 7 on the Independent Albums Chart, and number 1 on the Independent Albums Breakers Chart. The album also charted at number 81 on the Scottish Albums Chart. Clark later called it ""a huge success!""In 2015, the group found out that ""Sad Song"" had become their most popular song, despite the song not having a music video nor being performed live on tour. They noticed that the song had accumulated around 20 million plays on Spotify, which Clark initially presumed to be a mistake. Previously, ""Check Yes Juliet"" was the group's most popular song, selling 2,000 copies per week. ""Sad Song"", however, was selling 3,000 copies per week. Clark called it ""so strange. [...] I just remember finding out that it happened and just being so blown away that for once in our career, we let our fans choose, kind of accidentally, which song we were going to go with."" ""Sad Song"" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in March 2018."

FORGE Program,FORGE’s Mission,"FORGE aims to build upon the capacity of African refugees to cultivate empowered communities and to create the conditions for peace and prosperity in their countries.  FORGE believes that individuals affected by war are a key factor to breaking the cycle of war and poverty in Africa. Instead of providing relief work for refugees, FORGE aims at providing education and training to refugees in order to empower them with greater economic and leadership capacity. There are five main project areas that FORGE is now working on: Education, Economic Development, Health Education, Women’s Empowerment and Community Enrichment.
Recently, FORGE has launched a new program called the Collaborative Project Planning Process (CPPP). Believing that the most effective, relevant and sustainable development projects come from the insights and vision of the refugee community itself, FORGE launched the CPPP to provide refugees with the resources that are unreachable to them when building education and enrichment projects for their communities."
FORGE Program,Collaborative Project Planning Process (CPPP),"The collaborative project is a partnership built between FORGE and refugee leaders in the refugee camps where FORGE currently works. The planning of the project involves the following four stages.

Stage I - Identification of needs: The refugee community identifies its top needs and priorities.
Stage II – Assessment of needs: Selected community leaders research and evaluate these needs.
Stage III – Project proposal: The best intervention point is selected and leaders submit a Project Proposal to FORGE’s website for funding.
Stage IV – Funding and implementation: Once funded, the project is implemented, monitored and sustained by the community.To begin the CPPP, FORGE first recruits potential refugee leaders who are especially capable of spearheading development initiatives in the refugee camps. The CPPP then goes through the Stages I, II and III. The preparation work is all done by the refugee leaders and the role of the FORGE staff member is to give advice to the refugee leaders when necessary.  After all four stages of the CPPP are complete, the projects designed by the refugee leaders will begin and they are to run the projects for at least a year. The funding for new projects is coordinated by FORGE headquarters in the United States and is managed by a FORGE field staff member who serves as a facilitator and an adviser of the refugee leaders as well as a bridge of communication between the refugee camps and the US office.
Fundraising for new projects is basically the responsibility of the US office, although most international staff based in Zambia, including project managers, are required to raise a minimum of $5,000 to offset the costs of their monthly stipends. The fundraising for the Collaborative Projects happen between stage 2 and stage 3. There are currently three projects underway in this collaborative approach. They are the Block H Reliable Seed & Market Program, Mwangaza Education Centers and FORGE Health Service. These projects are now going through stage two and heading towards stage three."
FORGE Program,FORGE’s Development and Future,"Since its establishment, FORGE has worked in four refugee camps in Botswana and Zambia in central Africa. As the refugee camp in Botswana was beginning to decrease in size and the refugees were repatriating, FORGE started to retreat from the area and focus its work in Zambia where a large number of refugees have come from the countries surrounding Zambia due to civil wars.
FORGE has been working closely with the refugees in three refugee camps in Zambia: Meheba, Kala and Mwange. As peace was proclaimed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Congolese refugees in Kala and Mwange camps were beginning to repatriate under UNHCR's assistance. In light of this, FORGE is now planning to expand its work to the Congo in the coming years. FORGE aims to continue to support and help the former refugees to rebuild their lives in their home country of Congo by providing education, training and counseling until the people genuinely feel safe living in their homeland and have confidence to rebuild their communities on their own. As of December 2009, FORGE no longer operates in Kala and Mwange refugee camps."

Jai Bhim (film),Plot,"In 1993, Rajakannu and Sengeni are a couple from the oppressed Irula tribe who labor in the fields of oppressive caste men to control rat infestation and catch venomous snakes. Rajakannu is called to a rich man's dwelling to catch a snake that sneaked inside a room. The next day, a case of burglary is reported when the wife of the man reports missing jewellery pieces from her closet and raises doubt on Rajakannu. The police invade Rajakannu's home to find evidence. Rajakannu had left the town earlier for work. During the invasion, the police brutally beat and unlawfully detain the pregnant Sengeni. The police arrest other relatives: Rajakannu's brother Iruttupan, his sister Pachaiammal and his brother-in-law Mosakutty, and torture them to confess Rajakannu's whereabouts. The police find Rajakannu and imprison him. They torture him to confess the crime but release Sengeni. Later, she is informed that all three men in detention are absconding and police threaten her furthermore to tell them about their whereabouts.
Mythra, who teaches adults from the Irula tribe, learns about Chandru, a lawyer who fights cases for tribal communities, and manages to convince him to seek justice for Sengeni. After listening to the narration of all events that happened until then from Sengeni, Chandru files a habeas corpus case in the court. Initially the court advises them to file the petition in a lower court, but Chandru asks for witness examination, which is not the procedure in a habeas corpus case. But Chandru cites the Rajan case, and the court yields. The Solicitor general appearing for the police, based on the police officers' evidence, argues that Rajakannu and the other two had absconded from the police custody the night they were arrested. Finding gaps in the witnesses' statements, Chandru discovers that they were committing perjury and asks the court to investigate Sub-Inspector Gurumurthy (a casteist), head constable Veerasamy, and constable Kirubakaran.
Advocate General Ram Mohan takes over the case, and in defense of the police, claims that the three accused have fled to Kerala. Varadarajulu, the employer of Iruttapan, acknowledges that Iruttapan informed him through a phone call that he had fled to Kerala after committing robbery. Chandru discovered that the three policemen in question went to Kerala to make a phone call to Varadarajulu which Guru admits, that he mimicked the voice of Iruttapan. The court appoints IG Perumalsamy as the lead officer of this case, upon Chandru's request. After continuing search for weeks, Chandru, Perumalsamy and Mythra find that Rajakannu's corpse was found in the middle of a road near meters into border of Pondicherry, the day after he supposedly fled. He was cremated after being photographed as an unknown man. Both believe that Rajakannu did not die due to a car accident, rather due to lock-up murder.
Chandru consults the pathologist who conducted the post-mortem examination on Rajakannu. The pathologist says the cause of death was due to the breaking of the ribcage, which in turn, led a fragment of bone being driven into Rajakannu's heart, but theorises that this could be caused by a car running over him. Veerasamy confesses to Ram Mohan that Rajakannu died in custody. Veerasamy called Guru after the death. Guru told Veerasamy that he should stage that both have escaped and leave Rajakannu on the road, framing his death as occurring due to a car accident. Mosakutty and Iruttapan were transferred to another jail in Kerala. After hearing this, Ram Mohan advises them to maintain their narrative in court. Chandru checks the call history of the police station and informs the court that a call to Guru's residence was made at 9:10 pm, which does not corroborate with Veerasamy's evidence. Chandru asks the court for more time to investigate.
Chandru, Mythra, Sengeni, and the Irular tribe campaign against the injustice that had happened. Chandru finds that Irutappan indeed called Varadarajulu, but the police coerced him to make that call. Mythra finds Iruttapan and Mosakutty, and they testify in court about the torture all three of them went through and how the policemen killed Rajakannu. Perumalsamy says the policemen took bribes from the actual thief. Chandru also says that on the road where Rajakannu's corpse was found, there were a set of tire marks. There were also footprints that matched Guru's and Kiruba's footprints. After hearing these evidence, the court announces the verdict: the policemen who killed Rajakannu will be arrested; Sengeni will get ₹3 lakh (equivalent to ₹18 lakh or US$23,000 in 2020) and half a ground land as compensation; and Iruttapan, Mosakutty and Pachaiamma will get ₹2 lakh (equivalent to ₹12 lakh or US$15,000 in 2020) each. Sengeni thanks Chandru for his help, and Chandru attends the inauguration of Sengeni's new house, fulfilling Rajakannu's dream to get Sengeni a new house."

Jai Bhim (film),Production,
Jai Bhim (film),Development,"In March 2020, media reports surfaced that Suriya would be collaborating with T. J. Gnanavel, director of Kootathil Oruthan (2017) fame, for a legal drama film based on tribal people. Gnanavel earlier worked as dialogue writer in the Tamil-dubbed version of Suriya's Rakta Charitra 2 (2010), which was titled Ratha Sarithram. It was further stated that the film would be based on a true incident in 1993, and Suriya plays the role of a lawyer. His role is based on the real-life of retired Madras High Court Justice and former senior advocate K. Chandru, who faced a legal battle in order to bring justice for an Irular tribe woman. Her husband Rajakannu was arrested due to some unfortunate events and later disappeared from the police station that night. In the hope of justice for Rajakannu, she sought the help of Chandru who went beyond conventional lines to unearth the truth and bring justice to the woman and her family. Gnanavel also met the lawyer and interacted with him for several weeks, to understand further about the case. The team also took a workshop from actor–director R. Madhavan on making a biopic of a prominent individual in a short span of time, following the actor's work on Rocketry: The Nambi Effect (2022)."
Jai Bhim (film),Casting,"The project was formally announced in April 2021, with Suriya himself producing the film under 2D Entertainment banner. Initially, Roshini Haripriyan was approached for the role of Senggeni. But eventually the role went to Lijomol Jose. In May 2021, Malayalam film Rajisha Vijayan signed in for a pivotal role after her Tamil debut with Karnan (2021). Prakash Raj, Rao Ramesh and K. Manikandan, amongst others, were reportedly signed in for supporting roles, with music composer Sean Roldan, editor Philomin Raj, videographer S. R. Kathir, production designer Jacki and stunt co-ordinator duo Anbariv also a part of the technical crew. The title of the film Jai Bhim (based on the slogan used by followers of B. R. Ambedkar), was announced on 23 July 2021 (Suriya's birthday), with a first look release. The title was already taken by director Pa. Ranjith, a follower of Ambedkar's ideologies, and Suriya said Ranjith gave the film crew the title."
Jai Bhim (film),Filming,"Principal photography began in Kodaikanal during mid-April 2021, with Suriya joining the sets despite shooting for Etharkkum Thunindhavan (2021) in Karaikkudi. As production of the latter was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Suriya began working on the project with the shooting in Kodaikanal, which was further interrupted due to the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. In July 2021, shooting of the film resumed. Principal photography was wrapped up by September 2021."
Jai Bhim (film),Post-production,"In October 2021, the final copy of the film was submitted to the Central Board of Film Certification, which gave the film an ""A"" (adults-only) certificate, as some scenes have content that is suitable only for mature audiences. It is the first time a Suriya-starrer was given this rating since Rakta Charitra 2."
Jai Bhim (film),Music,"The film score and soundtrack is composed by Sean Roldan in his first collaboration with Suriya. The lyrics for the songs were written by Yugabharathi, Raju Murugan and Arivu. In August 2021, Roldan recorded the first track of the film (which was later deciphered as ""Power Song"") with vocals and lyrics written by Arivu. He further recorded the film's background score with orchestrator Matt Dunkley at Abbey Road Studios, London, with a snippet from the recording sessions uploaded to social media during mid-October. The music rights were purchased by Sony Music India, and the first single ""Power Song"" was released on 6 October 2021. The second single ""Thala Kodhum"" sung by Pradeep Kumar was released on 18 October.The original soundtrack album consisting of five tracks was released through music streaming platforms on 27 October 2021, with the jukebox being unveiled on YouTube, a day later. After the film's release, Sean Roldan performed few lines from the unreleased hidden track titled ""Manniley Eeramundu"" which was played during the climax of the film, at a chat session and following multiple requests, the makers released the aforementioned track as a single on 15 November 2021."

Jai Bhim (film),Streaming,"On 5 August 2021, 2D Entertainment signed a four-film deal with the streaming service Amazon Prime Video. As part of this deal, four of the studio's upcoming projects would premiere directly on Prime Video while bypassing theatrical release, which is a result of estimated losses incurred by non-existent theatrical releases due to the pandemic. Jai Bhim was scheduled for a streaming release during November 2021. On 2 October, the makers announced that the film would be released worldwide on 2 November 2021, ahead of the Diwali festival.

Jai Bhim (film),Home media,"The satellite rights were acquired by Kalaignar TV, and the film had its television premiere on 15 January 2022, coinciding with Pongal."
Jai Bhim (film),Reception,
Jai Bhim (film),Critical response,"The film received critical acclaim praising the script, performances (of Suriya, Lijomol Jose and Manikandan), direction and technical aspects.Ranjani Krishnakumar of Film Companion wrote, ""Jai Bhim is a solid film held together by craftly [sic] writing, thoughtful filmmaking, restrained performances and a true incident of the justice system restoring hope."" NDTV-based chief critic Saibal Chatterjee gave the film 3.5 out of 5 writing"" The amalgamation of the lead actor's charisma, the urgency of the theme and the force of the no-holds-barred storytelling results in an immersive and riveting film that calls attention to the plight of an oppressed community languishing on the fringes of society."" S. Srivatsan of The Hindu wrote ""'Jai Bhim' is perhaps one of the boldest films to have come out of Tamil cinema. It doesn't dare turn its back on hitting where it hurts the most, and its politics is not weighed down by the presence of a star like Suriya"" Writing for The Indian Express, Manoj Kumar R. gave the film 4 out of 5 writing ""Suriya feels natural and very comfortable in the role of a firebrand advocate. It is as if he's not just performing the lines written by the director, but he really believes in every word and gesture he delivers in this film."" Sowmya Rajendran of The News Minute also gave the film 4 out of 5 while writing ""As a courtroom drama and investigative thriller, based on real events, 'Jai Bhim' is head and shoulders above the average fare.""M. Suganth of The Times of India gave the film 3.5 out of 5 writing ""Gnanavel gives us some terrific moments of defiance. Lijomol Jose is quietly powerful as Sengani, who gets a couple of rousing scenes when she turns down efforts at a compromise from cops. Manikandan, too, is effective and stands out in the scene when he urges his men to not give in as that will result in their community being branded as criminals. The director also portrays the intimacy between Sengani and Rajakannu in a charming manner"". Ashameera Aiyyappan of Firstpost gave the film 4 out of 5 writing ""Jai Bhim is hard-hitting and intense. Unlike most commercial star vehicles, the film is decisively realistic. It tells a deeply important story with great nuance, ensuring that the people are not reduced to stereotypes."" Hindustan Times-based Haricharan Pudipeddi wrote ""Jai Bhim also talks about caste-based discrimination, and it doesn't try to sugar-coat things in the process. One of the highlights of Jai Bhim are the courtroom sequences which have been shot in the most realistic fashion. Suriya brings earnestness in his performance and plays the role of a lawyer with a lot of maturity, ensuring that his star image never comes in the way. It's Manikandan, who leaves you stunned with a gut-wrenching performance. Most of his scenes are shot in the interrogation room and he brings out the helplessness of his character effectively. Lijomol Jose as the lone woman standing against system that is rigged against her, is one of the best casting choices in recent times in Tamil cinema."" A critic from Onmanorama gave the film 3.5 out of 5 writing ""Rather than being a mere courtroom drama, Jai Bhim is a much-needed film from the past that will be relevant in the years to come, with new hope and a new beginning.""Janani K. of India Today gave the film 4.5 out of 5 writing ""Jai Bhim is an important film in the history of Tamil cinema. It shows how caste discrimination and injustice kill people. Jai Bhim is a film that also talks about the lack of humanity. Jai Bhim is a must-watch for its hard-hitting content and its ideologies. It's what society needs right now."" Sudhir Srinivasan, writing for Cinema Express gave the film 3.5 writing that ""despite all the attempts to create an engaging court experience, the film fails to create strong lawyer adversaries for Chandru [...] And yet, for all these missteps that prevent Jai Bhim from being an unforgettable film, it's still necessary to note that this is an important film that documents, with passion and good intentions, the oppression of a community. It's a film co-produced by a star, who's brave enough to almost slide himself into the background. Yes, he's a saviour in this film, sure, but he is not of the henchmen-beating, heroine-advising, agency-robbing kind, and neither is he the centrepoint of this story. Though he's a saviour, you could argue that he's also a 'victim'... of his good conscience. ""It's the only way I can get a good night's sleep,"" he says, explaining his motivation to represent the vulnerable. If only our society created more such victims"". Chief-editor Harish Wankhede's review in The Hindu suggests that the protagonist is ""an Ambedkarite hero who struggles to protect the life and dignity of the tribal people by adopting democratic and legal apparatuses. Further, the film presents the victim Sanggeni not as a powerless and wretched spectator but as a dignified claimant of equal rights and justice. It equally focuses on her brave struggle against the powerful establishment and promotes her as a parallel protagonist of the story."
Jai Bhim (film),Accolades,"The film was made available for screening at the 94th Academy Awards, but failed to get nominated."
Jai Bhim (film),Controversies,"Jai Bhim attracted opposition by the Vanniyar caste group Vanniyar Sangam (the parent organisation of Pattali Makkal Katchi or PMK), regarding a scene involving the character sub-inspector Gurumoorthy, which the PMK leaders claimed insulted the community. PMK leader Anbumani Ramadoss wrote a letter posing a series of questions about the film and how it defamed the community. In the film, an image of a pot of fire (a symbol of the Vanniyar community) was seen on a wall calendar in the sub-inspector's residence.Ramadoss criticised the choice to name the sub-inspector as Gurumoorthy, which he claims defames PMK leader Kaduvetti Guru. While the film used the names of the individuals in the case for their on-screen characters, the sub-inspector's character was not given the analogous individual's name, which was Anthonysamy. Suriya however responded that the film's team did not have any intention of hurting any single individual or a particular community. He also said that ""Through the film, questions have been raised against those in power, it should not be turned into name-politics and diluted.""Amid threats from supporters of the PMK and the Vanniyar Sangam, police protection was given to Suriya's residence in T. Nagar, Chennai. Numerous filmmakers, including Vetrimaaran, Lokesh Kanagaraj, Pa. Ranjith, C. S. Amudhan, Prakash Raj (who appeared in the film), Sathyaraj, and Siddharth, publicly spoke up in favour of Suriya, while associations such as South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce, Tamil Film Active Producers Association, and Nadigar Sangam raised objections to the attacks. The hashtag #WeStandWithSuriya started trending on Twitter, to which Suriya responded by thanking fans for their ""overwhelming support"". Gnanavel apologised on Twitter, saying that he takes responsibility for the controversy and that it was unfair to blame Suriya.A scene in the film where Prakash Raj's character Perumalsamy slaps a pawnbroker for speaking in Hindi and tells him to speak in Tamil sparked controversy on social media and was opposed by BJP. Some stated that it promoted anti-Hindi sentiment, while others countered by saying that Perumalsamy slaps the pawnbroker for trying to confuse him and evade questioning by speaking in a language that he does not understand when he can speak in Tamil. Prakash Raj responded to this by saying that ""they did not see the agony of the tribal people, they did not see and feel terrible about the injustice, they saw only the slap. That is all they understood; this exposes their agenda"", but confirmed that the pawnbroker, who knows Tamil, was indeed trying to evade questioning by speaking in Hindi.On 11 August 2022, the Madras High Court quashed criminal proceedings against Suriya and Gnanavel for allegedly hurting the sentiment of the Vanniyar community in the film. While the complainant had said that the film intended to incite violence and hostility on a particular community, the court observed that no such instance had been recorded."
Jai Bhim (film),Social impact,"Jai Bhim received an overwhelming response from members across the film fraternity, including Kamal Haasan, Siddharth, R. Madhavan, and Sivakarthikeyan, amongst others. Justice K. Chandru, who was closely associated with the film from the story discussions to post-production work had stated in an interview with The Federal, saying that ""the film is not a mere retelling of Sengini's tragic tale, but is more about throwing light on the larger picture of the victimisation of vulnerable communities like the Irula tribe"". M. K. Stalin, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, praised the film saying it had occupied his thoughts all night long. He stated that the core issue of the film reminded him of his own time in prison when arrested in 1976 under MISA (Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971) during the emergency period, and that his heart felt very heavy after watching the film. He congratulated Suriya and Gnanavel, and the entire film unit, saying that he wished more such films were made. He complimented Suriya's donation of ₹10 million (US$130,000) to the Pazhangudi Irular Trust for their education. Responding to Stalin's compliments, Suriya said, ""I am running out of words. The compliments of the Chief Minister have fulfilled the intent of Jai Bhim"" and thanked the politician on behalf of the team. Suriya promised to open a fixed deposit of ₹10 lakh in the name of Parvati Ammal. He said, ""The interest accrued for the FD will be handed over to Parvati Ammal every month and it will be ensured that the amount goes to her children after her death"".It was IMDb's most popular Indian film of the year. Jai Bhim also became the most-searched film of 2021 in India on Google. It was also fourth in the list of films that were tweeted about most in 2021, according to a report published by Twitter. Several publications including The Indian Express, The News Minute, Hindustan Times, Firstpost, and India Today, listed Jai Bhim as one of the best Tamil films of 2021. According to the social networking site Letterboxd, it was listed in the 15th position of ""highest rated International films of 2021"". A scene from the film was listed on The Oscars' official YouTube channel as a part of the segment ""Scene at the Academy"", with T. J. Gnanavel exploring about the making of the film. Raj Shinde, critic-based at the Indian website ThePrint cited Jai Bhim as one of the examples of how Indian cinema evolved in producing anti-caste films. The screenplay of the book published by Arunchol was published on January 2023."

Central Connecticut Conference,History,"In July 1999 founding member Enfield High school would leave the CCC Conference to join the NCCC. E.O. Smith applied to join the CCC Conference in 1999 due to increasing enrollment, E.O. Smith would replace the departing Enfield high school. The Central Connecticut Conference or (CCC) went through major expansion in 2009 with a total of 32 schools participating in the conference. In the 2015–16 school year, Avon High School joined the CCC. This made the conference change back to three divisions of eleven teams, with a blue and a white section in each division, with one having five teams and the other having six. Avon High School moved from the NCCC, where they were the largest school. Some of their competitors were not large enough to have freshman and/or junior varsity teams for Avon to compete against, leading to their move. Avon High school would be replacing Fermi High School which closed its doors at the end of the 2016 academic year, Fermi would merge all of its sports with Enfield High school becoming one school. Also in 2016 Weaver High School a founding member of the CCC Conference in 1984, announced they would be leaving the conference at the end of the 2016-2017 academic year due to low student enrollment. More expansion continued in 2018 when Lewis Mills high school voted to leave the Berkshire league and join the CCC conference beginning conference play in 2019. Lewis Mills would be replacing Rockville high school who left to join the NCCC Conference for the 2017-2018 season."

Xian (Taoism),The word xian,"The most famous Chinese compound of xiān is Bāxiān (八仙 ""the Eight Immortals""). Other common words include xiānrén (仙人 sennin in Japanese, ""immortal person; transcendent"", see Xiānrén Dòng), xiānrénzhăng (仙人掌 ""immortal's palm; cactus""), xiānnǚ (仙女 ""immortal woman; female celestial; angel""), and shénxiān (神仙 ""gods and immortals; divine immortal""). Besides humans, xiān can also refer to supernatural animals. The mythological húlijīng 狐狸精 (lit. ""fox spirit"") ""fox fairy; vixen; witch; enchantress"" has an alternate name of húxiān 狐仙 (lit. ""fox immortal"").
The etymology of xiān remains uncertain. The circa 200 CE Shiming, a Chinese dictionary that provided word-pun ""etymologies"",  defines xiān (仙) as ""to get old and not die,"" and explains it as someone who qiān (遷 ""moves into"") the mountains.""
Edward H. Schafer defined xian as ""transcendent, sylph (a being who, through alchemical, gymnastic and other disciplines, has achieved a refined and perhaps immortal body, able to fly like a bird beyond the trammels of the base material world into the realms of aether, and nourish himself on air and dew.)"" Schafer noted xian was cognate to xian 䙴 ""soar up"", qian 遷 ""remove"", and xianxian 僊僊 ""a flapping dance movement""; and compared Chinese yuren 羽人 ""feathered man; xian"" with English peri ""a fairy or supernatural being in Persian mythology"" (Persian pari from par ""feather; wing"").
Two linguistic hypotheses for the etymology of xian involve Arabic and Sino-Tibetan languages. Wu and Davis suggested the source was jinn, or jinni ""genie"" (from Arabic جني jinnī). ""The marvelous powers of the Hsien are so like those of the jinni of the Arabian Nights that one wonders whether the Arabic word, jinn, may not be derived from the Chinese Hsien."" Axel Schuessler's etymological dictionary suggests a Sino-Tibetan connection between xiān (Old Chinese *san or *sen) ""'An immortal' ... men and women who attain supernatural abilities; after death they become immortals and deities who can fly through the air"" and Tibetan gšen < g-syen ""shaman, one who has supernatural abilities, incl[uding] travel through the air""."
Xian (Taoism),The character and its variants,"The word xiān is written with three characters 僊, 仙, or 仚, which combine the logographic ""radical"" rén (人 or 亻 ""person; human"") with two ""phonetic"" elements (see Chinese character classification). The oldest recorded xiān character 僊 has a xiān (""rise up; ascend"") phonetic supposedly because immortals could ""ascend into the heavens"". (Compare qiān 遷 ""move; transfer; change"" combining this phonetic and the motion radical.) The usual modern xiān character 仙, and its rare variant 仚, have a shān (山 ""mountain"") phonetic. For a character analysis, Schipper interprets ""'the human being of the mountain,' or alternatively, 'human mountain'. The two explanations are appropriate to these beings: they haunt the holy mountains, while also embodying nature.""
The Classic of Poetry (220/3) contains the oldest occurrence of the character 僊, reduplicated as xiānxiān (僊僊 ""dance lightly; hop about; jump around""), and rhymed with qiān (遷). ""But when they have drunk too much, Their deportment becomes light and frivolous—They leave their seats, and [遷] go elsewhere, They keep [僊僊] dancing and capering."" (tr. James Legge) Needham and Wang suggest xian was cognate with wu 巫 ""shamanic"" dancing. Paper writes, ""the function of the term xian in a line describing dancing may be to denote the height of the leaps. Since, ""to live for a long time"" has no etymological relation to xian, it may be a later accretion.""The 121 CE Shuowen Jiezi, the first important dictionary of Chinese characters, does not enter 仙 except in the definition for 偓佺 (Wòquán ""name of an ancient immortal""). It defines 僊 as ""live long and move away"" and 仚 as ""appearance of a person on a mountaintop""."
Xian (Taoism),Textual references,"This section chronologically reviews how Chinese texts describe xian ""immortals; transcendents"". While the early Zhuangzi, Chuci, and Liezi texts allegorically used xian immortals and magic islands to describe spiritual immortality, later ones like the Shenxian zhuan and Baopuzi took immortality literally and described esoteric Chinese alchemical techniques for physical longevity.
On one the hand, neidan (內丹 ""internal alchemy"") techniques included taixi (胎息 ""embryonic respiration"") breath control, meditation, visualization, sexual training, and Tao Yin exercises (which later evolved into qigong and tai chi chuan).
On the other hand, waidan (外丹 ""external alchemy"") techniques for immortality included alchemical recipes, magic plants, rare minerals, herbal medicines, drugs, and dietetic techniques like inedia.
The word yuren 羽人 ""feathered person"" later meant ""Daoist"").
Besides the following major Chinese texts, many others use both graphic variants of xian. Xian (仙) occurs in the Chunqiu Fanlu, Fengsu Tongyi, Qian fu lun, Fayan, and Shenjian; xian (僊) occurs in the Caizhong langji, Fengsu Tongyi, Guanzi, and Shenjian."
Xian (Taoism),Zhuangzi,"Two circa 3rd century BCE ""Outer Chapters"" of the Zhuangzi (莊子 ""[Book of] Master Zhuang"") use the archaic character xian 僊. Chapter 11 has a parable about ""Cloud Chief"" (雲 將)  and ""Big Concealment"" (鴻濛) that uses the Shijing compound xianxian (""dance; jump""):

Big Concealment said, ""If you confuse the constant strands of Heaven and violate the true form of things, then Dark Heaven will reach no fulfillment. Instead, the beasts will scatter from their herds, the birds will cry all night, disaster will come to the grass and trees, misfortune will reach even to the insects. Ah, this is the fault of men who 'govern'!""""Then what should I do?"" said Cloud Chief.""Ah,"" said Big Concealment, ""you are too far gone! [僊僊] Up, up, stir yourself and be off!""Cloud Chief said, ""Heavenly Master, it has been hard indeed for me to meet with you—I beg one word of instruction!""""Well, then—mind‑nourishment!"" said Big Concealment. ""You have only to rest in inaction and things will transform themselves. Smash your form and body, spit out hearing and eyesight, forget you are a thing among other things, and you may join in great unity with the deep and boundless. Undo the mind, slough off spirit, be blank and soulless, and the ten thousand things one by one will return to the root—return to the root and not know why. Dark and undifferentiated chaos—to the end of life none will depart from it. But if you try to know it, you have already departed from it. Do not ask what its name is, do not try to observe its form. Things will live naturally end of themselves.""Cloud Chief said, ""The Heavenly Master has favored me with this Virtue, instructed me in this Silence. All my life I have been looking for it, and now at last I have it!"" He bowed his head twice, stood up, took his leave, and went away. (11)
Chapter 12 uses xian when mythical Emperor Yao describes a shengren (聖 人 ""sagely person"").

The true sage is a quail at rest, a little fledgling at its meal, a bird in flight who leaves no trail behind. When the world has the Way, he joins in the chorus with all other things. When the world is without the Way, he nurses his Virtue and retires in leisure. And after a thousand years, should he weary of the world, he will leave it and [上] ascend to [僊] the immortals, riding on those white clouds all the way up to the village of God. (12)
Without using the word xian, several Zhuangzi passages employ xian imagery, like flying in the clouds, to describe individuals with superhuman powers. For example, Chapter 1, within the circa 3rd century BCE ""Inner Chapters"", has two portrayals. First is this description of Liezi (below).

Lieh Tzu could ride the wind and go soaring around with cool and breezy skill, but after fifteen days he came back to earth. As far as the search for good fortune went, he didn't fret and worry. He escaped the trouble of walking, but he still had to depend on something to get around. If he had only mounted on the truth of Heaven and Earth, ridden the changes of the six breaths, and thus wandered through the boundless, then what would he have had to depend on? Therefore, I say, the Perfect Man has no self; the Holy Man has no merit; the Sage has no fame. (1) 
Second is this description of a shenren (神人 ""divine person"").

He said that there is a Holy Man living on faraway [姑射] Ku-she Mountain, with skin like ice or snow, and gentle and shy like a young girl. He doesn't eat the five grains, but sucks the wind, drinks the dew, climbs up on the clouds and mist, rides a flying dragon, and wanders beyond the Four Seas. By concentrating his spirit, he can protect creatures from sickness and plague and make the harvest plentiful. (1) 
The authors of the Zhuangzi had a lyrical view of life and death, seeing them as complementary aspects of natural changes. This is antithetical to the physical immortality (changshengbulao 長生不老 ""live forever and never age"") sought by later Daoist alchemists. Consider this famous passage about accepting death.

Chuang Tzu's wife died. When Hui Tzu went to convey his condolences, he found Chuang Tzu sitting with his legs sprawled out, pounding on a tub and singing. ""You lived with her, she brought up your children and grew old,"" said Hui Tzu. ""It should be enough simply not to weep at her death. But pounding on a tub and singing—this is going too far, isn't it?""
Chuang Tzu said, ""You're wrong. When she first died, do you think I didn't grieve like anyone else? But I looked back to her beginning and the time before she was born. Not only the time before she was born, but the time before she had a body. Not only the time before she had a body, but the time before she had a spirit. In the midst of the jumble of wonder and mystery a change took place and she had a spirit. Another change and she had a body. Another change and she was born. Now there's been another change and she's dead. It's just like the progression of the four seasons, spring, summer, fall, winter.""""Now she's going to lie down peacefully in a vast room. If I were to follow after her bawling and sobbing, it would show that I don't understand anything about fate. So I stopped. (18) 
Alan Fox explains this anecdote about Zhuangzi's wife.

Many conclusions can be reached on the basis of this story, but it seems that death is regarded as a natural part of the ebb and flow of transformations which constitute the movement of Dao. To grieve over death, or to fear one's own death, for that matter, is to arbitrarily evaluate what is inevitable. Of course, this reading is somewhat ironic given the fact that much of the subsequent Daoist tradition comes to seek longevity and immortality, and bases some of their basic models on the Zhuangzi."
Xian (Taoism),Chuci,"The 3rd-2nd century BCE Chuci (楚辭 ""Lyrics of Chu"") anthology of poems uses xian 仙 once and xian 僊 twice, reflecting the disparate origins of the text. These three contexts mention the legendary Daoist xian immortals Chi Song (赤松 ""Red Pine"", and Wang Qiao (王僑, or Zi Qiao 子僑). In later Daoist hagiography, Chi Song was Lord of Rain under Shennong, the legendary inventor of agriculture; and Wang Qiao was a son of King Ling of Zhou (r. 571–545 BCE), who flew away on a giant white bird, became an immortal and was never again seen."
Xian (Taoism),Yuan You,"The ""Yuan You"" (遠遊 ""Far-off Journey"") poem describes a spiritual journey into the realms of gods and immortals, frequently referring to Daoist myths and techniques.

My spirit darted forth and did not return to me,And my body, left tenantless, grew withered and lifeless.Then I looked into myself to strengthen my resolution,And sought to learn from where the primal spirit issues.In emptiness and silence I found serenity;In tranquil inaction I gained true satisfaction.I heard how once Red Pine had washed the world's dust off:I would model myself on the pattern he had left me.I honoured the wondrous powers of the [真人] Pure Ones,And those of past ages who had become [仙] Immortals.They departed in the flux of change and vanished from men's sight,Leaving a famous name that endures after them."
Xian (Taoism),Xi shi,"The ""Xi shi"" (惜誓 ""Sorrow for Troth Betrayed"") resembles the ""Yuan You"", and both reflect Daoist ideas from the Han period. ""Though unoriginal in theme,"" says Hawkes, ""its description of air travel, written in a pre-aeroplane age, is exhilarating and rather impressive.""
We gazed down of the Middle Land [China] with its myriad peopleAs we rested on the whirlwind, drifting about at random.In this way we came at last to the moor of Shao-yuan:There, with the other blessed ones, were Red Pine and Wang Qiao.The two Masters held zithers tuned in perfect concord:I sang the Qing Shang air to their playing.In tranquil calm and quiet enjoyment,Gently I floated, inhaling all the essences.But then I thought that this immortal life of [僊] the blessed,Was not worth the sacrifice of my home-returning."
Xian (Taoism),Ai shi ming,"The ""Ai shi ming"" (哀時命 ""Alas That My Lot Was Not Cast"") describes a celestial journey similar to the previous two.

Far and forlorn, with no hope of return:Sadly I gaze in the distance, over the empty plain.Below, I fish in the valley streamlet;Above, I seek out [僊] holy hermits.I enter into friendship with Red Pine;I join Wang Qiao as his companion.
We send the Xiao Yang in front to guide us;The White Tiger runs back and forth in attendance.Floating on the cloud and mist, we enter the dim height of heaven;Riding on the white deer we sport and take our pleasure."
Xian (Taoism),Li Sao,"The ""Li Sao"" (離騷 ""On Encountering Trouble""), the most famous Chuci poem, is usually interpreted as describing ecstatic flights and trance techniques of Chinese shamans. The above three poems are variations describing Daoist xian.
Some other Chuci poems refer to immortals with synonyms of xian. For instance, ""Shou zhi"" (守志 ""Maintaining Resolution), uses zhenren (真人 ""true person"", tr. ""Pure Ones"" above in ""Yuan You""), which Wang Yi's commentary glosses as zhen xianren (真仙人 ""true immortal person"").

I visited Fu Yue, bestriding a dragon,Joined in marriage with the Weaving Maiden,Lifted up Heaven's Net to capture evil,Drew the Bow of Heaven to shoot at wickedness,Followed the [真人] Immortals fluttering through the sky,Ate of the Primal Essence to prolong my life."
Xian (Taoism),Liezi,"The Liezi (列子 ""[Book of] Master Lie""), which Louis Komjathy says ""was probably compiled in the 3rd century CE (while containing earlier textual layers)"", uses xian four times, always in the compound xiansheng (仙聖 ""immortal sage"").
Nearly half of Chapter 2 (""The Yellow Emperor"") comes from the Zhuangzi, including this recounting of the above fable about Mount Gushe (姑射, or Guye, or Miao Gushe 藐姑射).

The Ku-ye mountains stand on a chain of islands where the Yellow River enters the sea. Upon the mountains there lives a Divine Man, who inhales the wind and drinks the dew, and does not eat the five grains. His mind is like a bottomless spring, his body is like a virgin's. He knows neither intimacy nor love, yet [仙聖] immortals and sages serve him as ministers. He inspires no awe, he is never angry, yet the eager and diligent act as his messengers. He is without kindness and bounty, but others have enough by themselves; he does not store and save, but he himself never lacks. The Yin and Yang are always in tune, the sun and moon always shine, the four seasons are always regular, wind and rain are always temperate, breeding is always timely, the harvest is always rich, and there are no plagues to ravage the land, no early deaths to afflict men, animals have no diseases, and ghosts have no uncanny echoes. 
Chapter 5 uses xiansheng three times in a conversation set between legendary rulers Tang (湯) of the Shang Dynasty and Ji (革) of the Xia Dynasty.

T'ang asked again: 'Are there large things and small, long and short, similar and different?'—'To the East of the Gulf of Chih-li, who knows how many thousands and millions of miles, there is a deep ravine, a valley truly without bottom; and its bottomless underneath is named ""The Entry to the Void"". The waters of the eight corners and the nine regions, the stream of the Milky Way, all pour into it, but it neither shrinks nor grows. Within it there are five mountains, called Tai-yü, Yüan-chiao, Fang-hu, Ying-chou and P'eng-Iai. These mountains are thirty thousand miles high, and as many miles round; the tablelands on their summits extend for nine thousand miles. It is seventy thousand miles from one mountain to the next, but they are considered close neighbours. The towers and terraces upon them are all gold and jade, the beasts and birds are all unsullied white; trees of pearl and garnet always grow densely, flowering and bearing fruit which is always luscious, and those who eat of it never grow old and die. The men who dwell there are all of the race of [仙聖] immortal sages, who fly, too many to be counted, to and from one mountain to another in a day and a night. Yet the bases of the five mountains used to rest on nothing; they were always rising and falling, going and returning, with the ebb and flow of the tide, and never for a moment stood firm. The [仙聖] immortals found this troublesome, and complained about it to God. God was afraid that they would drift to the far West and he would lose the home of his sages. So he commanded Yü-ch'iang to make fifteen [鼇] giant turtles  carry the five mountains on their lifted heads, taking turns in three watches, each sixty thousand years long; and for the first time the mountains stood firm and did not move.'But there was a giant from the kingdom of the Dragon Earl, who came to the place of the five mountains in no more than a few strides. In one throw he hooked six of the turtles in a bunch, hurried back to his country carrying them together on his back, and scorched their bones to tell fortunes by the cracks. Thereupon two of the mountains, Tai-yü and Yüan-chiao, drifted to the far North and sank in the great sea; the [仙聖] immortals who were carried away numbered many millions. God was very angry, and reduced by degrees the size of the Dragon Earl's kingdom and the height of his subjects. At the time of Fu-hsi and Shen-nung, the people of this country were still several hundred feet high.' 
Penglai Mountain became the most famous of these five mythical peaks where the elixir of life supposedly grew, and is known as Horai in Japanese legends. The first emperor Qin Shi Huang sent his court alchemist Xu Fu on expeditions to find these plants of immortality, but he never returned (although by some accounts, he discovered Japan).
Holmes Welch analyzed the beginnings of Daoism, sometime around the 4th-3rd centuries BCE, from four separate streams: philosophical Daoism (Laozi, Zhuangzi, Liezi), a ""hygiene school"" that cultivated longevity through breathing exercises and yoga, Chinese alchemy and Five Elements philosophy, and those who sought Penglai and elixirs of ""immortality"". This is what he concludes about xian.

It is my own opinion, therefore, that though the word hsien, or Immortal, is used by Chuang Tzu and Lieh Tzu, and though they attributed to their idealized individual the magic powers that were attributed to the hsien in later times, nonetheless the hsien ideal was something they did not believe in—either that it was possible or that it was good. The magic powers are allegories and hyperboles for the natural powers that come from identification with Tao. Spiritualized Man, P'eng-lai, and the rest are features of a genre which is meant to entertain, disturb, and exalt us, not to be taken as literal hagiography. Then and later, the philosophical Taoists were distinguished from all other schools of Taoism by their rejection of the pursuit of immortality. As we shall see, their books came to be adopted as scriptural authority by those who did practice magic and seek to become immortal. But it was their misunderstanding of philosophical Taoism that was the reason they adopted it."
Xian (Taoism),Shenxian zhuan,"The Shenxian zhuan (神仙傳 Biographies of Spirit Immortals"") is a hagiography of xian. Although it was traditionally attributed to Ge Hong (283–343 CE), Komjathy says, ""The received versions of the text contain some 100-odd hagiographies, most of which date from 6th-8th centuries at the earliest.""
According to the Shenxian zhuan, there are four schools of immortality:
Qì (气—""energy""): Breath control and meditation. Those who belong to this school can

""...blow on water and it will flow against its own current for several paces; blow on fire, and it will be extinguished; blow at tigers or wolves, and they will crouch down and not be able to move; blow at serpents, and they will coil up and be unable to flee. If someone is wounded by a weapon, blow on the wound, and the bleeding will stop. If you hear of someone who has suffered a poisonous insect bite, even if you are not in his presence, you can, from a distance, blow and say in incantation over your own hand (males on the left hand, females on the right), and the person will at once be healed even if more than a hundred li away. And if you yourself are struck by a sudden illness, you have merely to swallow pneumas in three series of nine, and you will immediately recover.But the most essential thing [among such arts] is fetal breathing. Those who obtain [the technique of] fetal breathing become able to breathe without using their nose or mouth, as if in the womb, and this is the culmination of the way [of pneumatic cultivation]."" 
Fàn (饭—""Diet""): Ingestion of herbal compounds and abstention from the Sān Shī Fàn (三尸饭—""Three-Corpses food"")—Meats (raw fish, pork, dog, leeks, and scallions) and grains. The Shenxian zhuan uses this story to illustrate the importance of bigu ""grain avoidance"":

""During the reign of Emperor Cheng of the Han, hunters in the Zhongnan Mountains saw a person who wore no clothes, his body covered with black hair. Upon seeing this person, the hunters wanted to pursue and capture him, but the person leapt over gullies and valleys as if in flight, and so could not be overtaken. [But after being surrounded and captured, it was discovered this person was a 200 plus year old woman, who had once been a concubine of Qin Emperor Ziying. When he had surrendered to the 'invaders of the east', she fled into the mountains where she learned to subside on 'the resin and nuts of pines' from an old man. Afterwards, this diet 'enabled [her] to feel neither hunger nor thirst; in winter [she] was not cold, in summer [she] was not hot.']The hunters took the woman back in. They offered her grain to eat. When she first smelled the stink of grain, she vomited, and only after several days could she tolerate it. After little more than two years of this [diet], her body hair fell out; she turned old and died. Had she not been caught by men, she would have become a transcendent."" 
Fángzhōng Zhī Shù (房中之术—""Arts of the Bedchamber""): Sexual yoga. According to a discourse between the Yellow Emperor and the immortaless Sùnǚ (素女—""Plain Girl""), one of the three daughters of Hsi Wang Mu,

 ""The sexual behaviors between a man and woman are identical to how the universe itself came into creation. Like Heaven and Earth, the male and female share a parallel relationship in attaining an immortal existence. They both must learn how to engage and develop their natural sexual instincts and behaviors; otherwise the only result is decay and traumatic discord of their physical lives. However, if they engage in the utmost joys of sensuality and apply the principles of yin and yang to their sexual activity, their health, vigor, and joy of love will bear them the fruits of longevity and immortality. 
The White Tigress (Zhuang Li Quan Pure Angelic Metal Ajna Empress ""Toppest"") Manual, a treatise on female sexual yoga, states,

 ""A female can completely restore her youthfulness and attain immortality if she refrains from allowing just one or two men in her life from stealing and destroying her [sexual] essence, which will only serve in aging her at a rapid rate and bring about an early death. However, if she can acquire the sexual essence of a thousand males through absorption, she will acquire the great benefits of youthfulness and immortality."" 
Dān (丹—""Alchemy"", literally ""Cinnabar""): Elixir of Immortality."
Xian (Taoism),Baopuzi,"The 4th century CE Baopuzi (抱朴子 ""[Book of] Master Embracing Simplicity""), which was written by Ge Hong, gives some highly detailed descriptions of xian.
The text lists three classes of immortals:

Tiānxiān (天仙—""Celestial Immortal""): The highest level.
Dìxiān (地仙—""Earth Immortal""): The middle level.
Shījiě xiān (尸解仙—""Escaped-by-means-of-a-stimulated-corpse-simulacrum Immortal"", literally ""Corpse Untie Immortal""): The lowest level. This is considered the lowest form of immortality since a person must first ""fake"" their own death by substituting a bewitched object like a bamboo pole, sword, talisman or a shoe for their corpse or slipping a type of Death certificate into the coffin of a newly departed paternal grandfather, thus having their name and ""allotted life span"" deleted from the ledgers kept by the Sīmìng (司命—""Director of allotted life spans"", literally ""Controller of Fate""). Hagiographies and folktales abound of people who seemingly die in one province, but are seen alive in another. Mortals who choose this route must cut off all ties with family and friends, move to a distant province, and enact the Ling bao tai xuan yin sheng zhi fu (靈寳太玄隂生之符—""Numinous Treasure Talisman of the Grand Mystery for Living in Hiding"") to protect themselves from heavenly retribution. However, this is not a true form of immortality. For each misdeed a person commits, the Director of allotted life spans subtracts days and sometimes years from their allotted life span. This method allows a person to live out the entirety of their allotted lifespan (whether it be 30, 80, 400, etc.) and avoid the agents of death. But the body still has to be transformed into an immortal one, hence the phrase Xiānsǐ hòutuō (先死後脱—""The 'death' is apparent, [but] the sloughing off of the body's mortality remains to be done.""). Sometimes the Shījiě are employed by heaven to act as celestial peace keepers. Therefore, they have no need for hiding from retribution since they are empowered by heaven to perform their duties. There are three levels of heavenly Shījiě:
Dìxià zhǔ (地下主—""Agents Beneath the Earth""): Are in charge of keeping the peace within the Chinese underworld. They are eligible for promotion to earthbound immortality after 280 years of faithful service.
Dìshàng zhǔzhě (地上主者—""Agents Above the Earth""): Are given magic talismans which prolong their lives (but not indefinitely) and allow them to heal the sick and exorcize demons and evil spirits from the earth. This level was not eligible for promotion to earthbound immortality.
Zhìdì jūn (制地君—""Lords Who Control the Earth""): A heavenly decree ordered them to ""disperse all subordinate junior demons, whether high or low [in rank], that have cause afflictions and injury owing to blows or offenses against the Motion of the Year, the Original Destiny, Great Year, the Kings of the Soil or the establishing or breaking influences of the chronograms of the tome. Annihilate them all."" This level was also not eligible for promotion to immortality.These titles were usually given to humans who had either not proven themselves worthy of or were not fated to become immortals. One such famous agent was Fei Changfang, who was eventually murdered by evil spirits because he lost his book of magic talismans. However, some immortals are written to have used this method in order to escape execution.Ge Hong wrote in his book The Master Who Embraces Simplicity,

The [immortals] Dark Girl and Plain Girl compared sexual activity as the intermingling of fire [yang/male] and water [yin/female], claiming that water and fire can kill people but can also regenerate their life, depending on whether or not they know the correct methods of sexual activity according to their nature. These arts are based on the theory that the more females a man copulates with, the greater benefit he will derive from the act. Men who are ignorant of this art, copulating with only one or two females during their life, will only suffice to bring about their untimely and early death."
Xian (Taoism),Zhong Lü Chuan Dao Ji,"The Zhong Lü Chuan Dao Ji (鐘呂傳道集/钟吕传道集 ""Anthology of the Transmission of the Dao from Zhong[li Quan] to Lü [Dongbin]"") is associated with Zhongli Quan (2nd century CE?) and Lü Dongbin (9th century CE), two of the legendary Eight Immortals. It is part of the so-called ""Zhong-Lü"" (鍾呂) textual tradition of internal alchemy (neidan). Komjathy describes it as, ""Probably dating from the late Tang (618–906), the text is in question-and-answer format, containing a dialogue between Lü and his teacher Zhongli on aspects of alchemical terminology and methods.""The Zhong Lü Chuan Dao Ji lists five classes of immortals:

Guǐxiān (鬼仙—""Ghost Immortal""): A person who cultivates too much yin energy. These immortals are likened to Vampires because they drain the life essence of the living, much like the fox spirit. Ghost immortals do not leave the realm of ghosts.
Rénxiān (人仙—Human Immortal""): Humans have an equal balance of yin and yang energies, so they have the potential of becoming either a ghost or immortal. Although they continue to hunger and thirst and require clothing and shelter like a normal human, these immortals do not suffer from aging or sickness. Human immortals do not leave the realm of humans. There are many sub-classes of human immortals, as discussed above under Shījiě xiān.
Dìxiān (地仙—""Earth Immortal""): When the yin is transformed into the pure yang, a true immortal body will emerge that does not need food, drink, clothing or shelter and is not affected by hot or cold temperatures. Earth immortals do not leave the realm of earth. These immortals are forced to stay on earth until they shed their human form.
Shénxiān (神仙—""Spirit Immortal""): The immortal body of the earthbound class will eventually change into vapor through further practice. They have supernatural powers and can take on the shape of any object. These immortals must remain on earth acquiring merit by teaching mankind about the Tao. Spirit immortals do not leave the realm of spirits. Once enough merit is accumulated, they are called to heaven by a celestial decree.
Tiānxiān (天仙—""Celestial Immortal""): Spirit immortals who are summoned to heaven are given the minor office of water realm judge. Over time, they are promoted to oversee the earth realm and finally become administrators of the celestial realm. These immortals have the power to travel back and forth between the earthly and celestial realms."
Xian (Taoism),Śūraṅgama Sūtra,"The Śūraṅgama Sūtra, a mahayana Buddhist manuscript, in an approach to Taoist teachings, discusses the characteristics of ten types of xian who exist between the world of devas (""gods"") and that of human beings. This position, in Buddhist literature, is usually occupied by asuras (""Titans"", ""antigods""), but these beings are of another type. These xian are not considered true cultivators of samadhi (""unification of mind""), as their methods differ from the practice of dhyāna (""meditation"").
Dìxiān (地(行)仙; Dìxíng xiān, ""earth-travelling immortals"") – Xian who constantly ingest special food called fuer (服餌).
Fēixiān (飛(行)仙; Fēixíng xiān, ""flying immortals"") – Xian who constantly ingest certain herbs and plants.
Yóuxiān (遊(行)仙; Yóuxíng xiān, ""roaming immortals"") – Xian who ""transform"" by constantly ingesting metals and minerals.
Kōngxiān (空(行)仙; Kōngxíng xiān, ""void-travelling immortals"") – Xian who perfect their qi and essence through unceasing movement and stillness (dongzhi 動止).
Tiānxiān (天(行)仙; Tiānxíng xiān, ""heaven-travelling immortals"") – Xian who constantly practice control of their fluids and saliva.
Tōngxiān (通(行)仙; Tōngxíng xiān, ""all-penetrating immortals"") – Xian who constantly practice the inhalation of unadulterated essences.
Dàoxiān (道(行)仙; Dàoxíng xiān, ""immortals of the Way"") – Xian who achieve transcendence through unceasing recitation of spells and prohibitions.
Zhàoxiān (照(行)仙; Zhàoxíng xiān, ""illuminated immortals"") – Xian who achieve transcendence through constant periods of thought and recollection.
Jīngxiān (精(行)仙; Jīngxíng xiān, ""seminal immortals"") – Xian who have mastered the stimuli and responses of intercourse.
Juéxiān (絕(行)仙; Juéxíng xiān, ""absolute immortals"") – Xian who ""have attained the end"" and perfected their awakening through constant transformation."
Xian (Taoism),In art and culture,"According to Michael Loewe, the earliest artistic and textual evidence of xian transcendents dates from the fifth or fourth centuries BCE. They were depicted as avian and serpentine hybrids who could fly through the universe, typically either combinations of a bird's body and a human face, or a human with wings sprouting on their back, i.e., a yuren (羽人, ""feathered person""). In tomb reliefs from the Eastern Han dynasty (25-220 CE), xian are often bird-human and reptile-human hybrids, depicted as ""liminal but spiritually empowered figures"" who accompanied a deceased person's soul to paradise, ""transient figures moving through an intermediate realm"" where they are often joined by deer, tigers, dragons, birds, heavenly horses (tianma 天馬), and other animals. These avian, serpentine, and human hybrid xians are frequently depicted with ""secondary characteristics"" including androgyny, large ears, long hair, exaggerated nonhuman faces, tattoo-like markings, and nudity; many of these traits also appear in depictions of foreigners, who also lived outside the Chinese cultural and spiritual sphere.Xian are conventionally held to be beings that bring good fortune and ""benevolent spirits"".In Japan, sennin image was perpetuated in many legends, art, miniature sculpture (netsuke). Below is a wooden netsuke, made in the 18th century. It represents a perplexed old man with one hand based on the curve of a snag, and the other hand is rubbing his head with concern. He is looking somewhere in the sky and tucked up the right leg. This position betrayed him as Sennin Tekkay, whose soul has found the second life in the body of the lame beggar. In shape the beggarly old man this legendary personality portrayed prominent carver of the early period Jobun.
Sennin is a common Japanese character name. For example, Ikkaku Sennin (一角仙人 ""One-horned Immortal"") was a Noh play by Komparu Zenpō (金春禅鳳, 1454–1520?). The Japanese legend of Gama Sennin (蝦蟇仙人 ""Toad Immortal"") is based upon Chinese Liu Hai, a fabled 10th-century alchemist who learned the secret of immortality from the Chan Chu (""Three-legged Money Toad"")."
Xian (Taoism),Sovereigns,"The Three Sovereigns had similarities to xian and could have been considered such.
The Sancai Tuhui, an encyclopedia from 1607, depicts the Human Sovereign as a reptilian being with ears similar to feathers, much like Han Dynasty depictions of xian."

History of Madagascar,First inhabitants and settlements (500 BCE–700 CE),
History of Madagascar,Archaeological evidence for date of first settlement,"The earliest unambiguous evidence of continuous human presence in Madagascar was found at Andavakoera and dates to 490 CE, and there is no archaeological evidence for human occupation in the highlands until around 1200. However, there is scattered evidence for much earlier human visits.
In 2009, archaeological excavations at Christmas River (south-central Madagascar) by Pat Wright and James Hansford located a purported elephant bird kill site, with bones showing human cut marks. These were dated to 8,500 BCE, but as yet there is no indication as to the identity of the hunters. Archaeological finds such as cut marks on bones found in the northwest and stone tools in the northeast indicate that Madagascar was visited by foragers around 2000 BCE.There is potential evidence in the form of a cutmarked subfossil lemur bone from a palaeontological site, Taolambiby, in the southwest. One date was obtained, calibrated 530 to 300 BCE (Godfrey & Jungers 2003). The cutmarking looks plausible, but there is a potential problem of old carbon from the limestone landscape compromising the date, and there are no associated artifacts or archaeological sites in the vicinity. Nearly contemporaneous potential evidence comes from cannabis or humulus pollen which occurs in a pollen column from the central highlands at an interpolated date of c. 2200 Before Present (BP). There is a hypothesis that cannabis may have reached Africa 3000 years ago.
Necho II's Phoenician expedition c. 595 BCE circumnavigated Africa but did not see Madagascar when passing through the Mozambique Channel, as it stayed within sight of the African mainland. The island was likely uninhabited.Finally, a cutmarked pygmy hippo bone from Ambolisatra has been dated and calibrated to between 60 BCE and 130 CE (2 SDs), but it is from a coastal swamp without indications of settlement in a heavily karstic region. Moreover, a similar bone from the same collection from a nearby site gave two widely divergent dates of 2020 and 3495 BP (MacPhee & Burney 1991). Transient visits to Madagascar that did not result in enduring settlement cannot be ruled out, and may have left some traces."
History of Madagascar,A common Austronesian origin: The Vahoaka Ntaolo,"Factual information about the peopling of Madagascar remains incomplete, but much recent multidisciplinary research and work in archaeology, genetics, linguistics, and history confirms that the Malagasy people were originally and overwhelmingly Austronesian peoples native to the Sunda Islands. They probably arrived on the west coast of Madagascar with outrigger canoes (waka) at the beginning of our era or as much as 300 years sooner according to archaeologists, and perhaps even earlier under certain geneticists' assumptions. On the basis of plant cultigens, Blench proposed the migrations occurred ""at the earliest century BCE"".: 432  Archaeological work of Ardika and Bellwood suggests migration between 500 and 200 BCE.The Borobudur Ship Expedition in 2003–2004 affirmed scholars' ideas that ships from ancient Indonesia could have reached Madagascar and the west African coast for trade from the 8th century and after. A traditional Borobudur ship with outriggers was reconstructed and sailed in this expedition from Jakarta to Madagascar and Ghana. As for the ancient route, one possibility is that Indonesian Austronesians came directly across the Indian Ocean from Java to Madagascar. It is likely that they went through the Maldives where evidence of old Indonesian boat design and fishing technology persists until the present. The Malagasy language originated from the Southeast Barito language, and Ma'anyan language is its closest relative, with numerous Malay and Javanese loanwords. It is known that Ma'anyan people were brought as laborers and slaves by Malay and Javanese people in their trading fleets, which reached Madagascar by ca. 50–500 AD. These pioneers are known in the Malagasy oral tradition as the Ntaolo, from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *tau-ulu, literally 'first men', from *tau, 'man', and *ulu, 'head; first; origin, beginning. It is likely that those ancient people called themselves *va-waka, ""the canoe people"" from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *va, 'people', and *waka 'canoe'. Today the term vahoaka means 'people' in Malagasy.

The Southeast Asian origin of the first Malagasy people explains certain features common among the Malagasy, for instance, the epicanthic fold common among all Malagasy whether coastal or highlands, whether pale, dark or copper skinned. This original population (vahoaka ntaolo) can be called the ""Proto-Malagasy"". They are the source of:

the Malagasy language, common to the whole island, which shares many common roots with the Austronesian languages of Barito subgroup, which originated in South Kalimantan, such as Ma'anyan.
Malagasy cultural traditions shared with Austronesians of Taiwan, the Pacific Islands, Indonesia, New Zealand, and the Philippines including ancient customs, such as burying the dead within a canoe in the sea or in a lake, the cultivation of traditional Austronesian crops such as taro or saonjo, banana, coconut, and sugar cane, traditional architecture with a square house plan, music and musical instruments such as the antsiva conch, the hazolahy drum, the atranatrana xylophone, sodina flute, or the valiha tube zither, and dance, including the ""bird dance"" found both in central and southern regions.As for the cause of the coming of these Austronesians, the history of the Indian Ocean from the early first millennium CE is still poorly understood. Madagascar may have played an important role in the trade of spices (especially cinnamon) and timber between Southeast Asia and the Middle East, directly or through the African coast and Madagascar."
History of Madagascar,Vazimba and Vezo,"The first known concentrated population of human settlers emerged along the southeastern coast of the island, although the first landfall may have been made on the northern coast. Upon arrival, early settlers practiced tavy (slash-and-burn agriculture) to clear the virgin coastal rainforests for the cultivation of their crops. The first settlers encountered Madagascar's wealth of megafauna, including giant lemurs, elephant birds, giant fossa and the Malagasy hippopotamus, which have since become extinct due to hunting and habitat destruction.By 600, groups of these early settlers had moved inland and began clearing the forests of the central highlands (Imerina), where they particularly planted taro (saonjo) and probably rice (vary). These Vahoaka Ntaolo, hunters-gatherers and farmers, who decided to settle ""in the forest"", especially in the forests of the central highlands are known by the tradition as the Vazimba (from *ba/va-yimba- 'those of the forest', from *yimba- 'forest' in Proto–Southeast Barito, today barimba or orang rimba in Malay). Rafandrana, an ancestor of the Merina royal dynasty, for example, is known to have been a Vazimba. Rafohy and Rangita, the two founding queens of the Merina royalty, were also called Vazimbas.

On the other side, the fishermen who, from the beginning, remained on the southwestern coast (probably the coasts of the first landing) were, according to the linguists, probably originally called the Vezo (from *ba/va/be/ve-jau – ""those of the coast"", borrowed from Proto-Malayo-Javanese, today veju in Bugis, bejau in Malay, and bajo in Javanese), which today is still the name of a Southwestern tribe.

After the arrival of the newcomers (see below), as growing population density necessitated higher crop yields, irrigated rice paddies emerged in Betsileo country by 1600 and were complemented with terraced paddies throughout the central highlands a century later. Zebu were introduced around 1000 by Bantu-speaking migrants from the African Great Lakes region (see below), who maintained large herds. The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage in the central highlands had largely transformed the region from a forest ecosystem to barren grassland by the 17th century."
History of Madagascar,"Traders, explorers, and immigration (700–1500)","By the mid-first millennium (ca 700) until about 1500, the inner Vazimbas as much as the coastal Vezos clans welcome new visitors or immigrants. These goods and/or slave traders came from the Middle East (Shirazi Persians, Omani Arabs, Arab Jews, accompanied by Bantus from southeast Africa) and from Asia (Gujaratis, Malays, Javanese, Bugis). They were sometimes integrated within the coastal Vezos and the inner Vazimbas clans."
History of Madagascar,Omani Arabs (from the 7th century),"The written history of Madagascar begins in the 7th century when Omanis established trading posts along the northwest coast and introduced Islam, the Arabic script (used to transcribe the Malagasy language in a form of writing known as the sorabe alphabet), Arab astrology and other cultural elements. During this early period, Madagascar served as an important transoceanic trading port for the East African coast that gave Africa a trade route to the Silk Road and served simultaneously as a port for incoming ships. There is evidence that Bantu or Swahili sailors or traders may have begun sailing to the western shores of Madagascar as early as around the 6th and 7th century.According to the traditions of some Malagasy peoples, the first Bantus and Arabs to settle in Madagascar came as refugees from the civil wars that followed the death of Muhammad in 632.
Beginning in the 10th or 11th century, Arabic and Zanzibari slavers worked their way down the Swahili coast in their dhows and established settlements on the west coast of Madagascar. Notably they included the Zafiraminia, traditional ancestors of the Antemoro, Antanosy and other east coast ethnicities. The last wave of Arab immigrants, the Antalaotra, immigrated from Swahili colonies. They settled the northwest of the island (the Mahajanga area) and introduced, for the first time, Islam to Madagascar.Arab immigrants, though few in number compared to the native Austronesians and Bantus, nevertheless left a lasting impression. The Malagasy names for seasons, months, days, and coins in certain regions come from Arabic origins, as do cultural features such as the practice of circumcision, the communal grain-pool, and different forms of salutation (such as salama)."
History of Madagascar,"Neo-Austronesians: Malays, Javanese, Bugis, and Orang Laut (from the 8th century)","According to oral tradition, new Austronesian clans (Malays, Javanese, Bugis, and Orang Laut), historically referred to in general, regardless of their native island, as the ""Hova"" (from Old Bugis uwa, ""commoner"") landed in the north-west and east coast of the island. Adelaar's observations of Old Malay (Sanskritised), Old Javanese (Sanskritised) and Old Bugis borrowings in the initial Proto-Southeast-Barito language indicate that the first Hova waves came probably in the 7th century at the earliest. Marre and Dahl pointed out that the number of Sanskrit words in Malagasy is very limited compared with the large number now found in Indonesian languages, which means that the Indonesian settlers must have come at an early stage of Hindu influence, that is ca. 400 AD.The Hova were probably derived from Indonesian thalassocracies. Their leaders were known as the diana in the Southeast and andriana or raondriana in the Center and the West (from (ra)-hadi-an, ""lord"" or ""master"" in Old Javanese, modern Javanese raden, also found in the Bugis noble title andi and the Tagalog word for ""king"" hari). They for the most part allied with Vazimba clans:
In the Northwest area of the current Ankoala (from kuala, ""estuary"" in Malay and Indonesian) where the Hova Orang Laut (Antalaotra in Malagasy) had probably established their base for their Indian Ocean operations.
On the east coast (Betsimisaraka) where the Hova leaders were also called Filo (ha) be by the ""neo-Vezo"" clans.
In the southeast where the leaders (""Diana"") of the Zafiraminia and Zafikazimambo clans allied with the ""neo-Vezo"" and founded the later Antaisaka, Antaimoro and Antambahoaka kingdoms.
In the west: the Maroserana dynasty which founded the Sakalava Kingdom is itself a result of Zafiraminia on the east coast.
In the Center where repeated alliances among the Hova leaders (the andriana) (such as Andrianerinerina, Andriantomara and their descendants) with the chiefs of Vazimba clans (such as Rafandrana and his descendants) led to the Merina and Betsileo Kingdoms.With the arrival of Islam, Persian and Arab traders soon supplanted the Indonesians on the coast of Africa and eventually extended their control over the Comoro Islands and parts of the coast of Madagascar. Meanwhile, with competition in the new joint naval powers of Song China and Chola South India, the thalassocracies of Indonesia were in rapid decline, though the Portuguese still encountered Javanese sailors in Madagascar in the sixteenth century."
History of Madagascar,Bantus (from the 9th century),"There is archaeological evidence that Bantu peoples, agro-pastoralists from East Africa, may have begun migrating to the island as early as the 6th and 7th century. Other historical and archaeological records suggest that some of the Bantus were descendants of Swahili sailors and merchants who used dhows to traverse the seas to the western shores of Madagascar. Finally some sources theorize that during the Middle Ages, Arab, Persian and Neo-Austronesian slave-traders brought Bantu people to Madagascar transported by Swahili merchants to feed foreign demand for slaves. Years of intermarriages created the Malagasy people, who primarily speak Malagasy, an Austronesian language with Bantu influences. There are consequently many (Proto-)Swahili borrowings in the initial Proto-SEB Malagasy language. This substratum is especially significantly present in the domestic and agricultural vocabulary (e.g. omby or aombe, ""beef"", from Swahili ng'ombe; tongolo ""onion"" from Swahili kitunguu; Malagasy nongo ""pot"" from nunggu in Swahili)."
History of Madagascar,Europeans (from 1500),"Europe knew of Madagascar through Arab sources; thus The Travels of Marco Polo claimed that ""the inhabitants are Saracens, or followers of the law of Mohammed"", without mentioning other inhabitants. Other than its size and location, everything about the island in the book describes southeastern Africa, not Madagascar. European contact began on 10 August 1500, when the Portuguese sea captain Diogo Dias sighted the island after his ship separated from a fleet going to India. The Portuguese traded with the islanders and named the island São Lourenço (Saint Lawrence). In 1666, François Caron, the director general of the newly formed French East India Company, sailed to Madagascar. The company failed to establish a colony on Madagascar but established ports on the nearby islands of Bourbon (now Réunion) and Isle de France (now Mauritius). In the late 17th century, the French established trading posts along the east coast. On Île Sainte-Marie, a small island off the northeastern coast of Madagascar, Captain Misson and his pirate crew allegedly founded the famous pirate utopia of Libertatia in the late 17th century. From about 1774 to 1824, Madagascar was a favourite haunt for pirates.  Many European sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island, among them Robert Drury, whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern Madagascar during the 18th century. Sailors sometimes called Madagascar ""Island of the Moon""."
History of Madagascar,European settlements,"By the 15th century, Europeans had wrested control of the spice trade from the Muslims. They did this by bypassing the Middle East and sending their cargo-ships around the Cape of Good Hope to India. The Portuguese mariner Diogo Dias became the first European to set foot on Madagascar when his ship, bound for India, blew off course in 1500. In the ensuing 200 years, the English and French tried (and failed) to establish settlements on the island.
Fever, dysentery, hostile Malagasy, and the trying arid climate of southern Madagascar soon terminated the English settlement near Toliara in 1646. Another English settlement in the north in Île Sainte-Marie came to an end in 1649. The French colony at Tôlanaro (Fort Dauphin) fared a little better: it lasted thirty years. On Christmas night 1672, local Antanosy tribesmen, perhaps angry because fourteen French soldiers in the fort had recently divorced their Malagasy wives to marry fourteen French orphan-women sent out to the colony, massacred the fourteen grooms and thirteen of the fourteen brides. The Antanosy then besieged the stockade at Tôlanaro for eighteen months. A ship of the French East India Company rescued the surviving thirty men and one widow in 1674.
In 1665, François Caron, the Director General of the newly formed French East India Company, sailed to Madagascar. The Company failed to found a colony on Madagascar but established ports on the nearby islands of Bourbon and Île-de-France (today's Réunion and Mauritius respectively). In the late 17th century, the French established trading-posts along the east coast."
History of Madagascar,Pirates and slave-traders,"Between 1680 and 1725, Madagascar became a pirate stronghold. Many unfortunate sailors became shipwrecked and stranded on the island. Those who survived settled down with the natives, or more often, found French or English colonies on the island or even pirate havens and thus became pirates themselves. One such case, that of Robert Drury,
resulted in a journal giving one of the few written depictions of southern Madagascar in the 18th century.
Notable pirates including William Kidd, Henry Every, John Bowen, and Thomas Tew made Antongil Bay and Île Sainte-Marie (a small island 12 miles off the northeast coast of Madagascar) their bases of operations. The pirates plundered merchant ships in the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf. They deprived Europe-bound ships of their silks, cloth, spices, and jewels. Vessels captured going in the opposite direction (to India) lost their coin, gold, and silver. The pirates robbed the Indian cargo ships that traded between ports in the Indian Ocean as well as ships commissioned by the East India Companies of France, England, and the Netherlands. The pilgrim fleet sailing between Surat in India and Mocha on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula were a favorite target, because the wealthy Muslim pilgrims often carried jewels and other finery with them to Mecca. Merchants in India, various ports of Africa, and Réunion showed willingness to fence the pirates' stolen goods. The low-paid seamen who manned merchant ships in the Indian Ocean hardly put up a fight, seeing as they had little reason or motivation to risk their lives. The pirates often recruited crewmen from the ships they plundered.
With regard to piracy in Malagasy waters, note the (semi-)legendary accounts of the alleged pirate-state of Libertalia.
Prior to the arrival of the Europeans, certain Malagasy tribes occasionally waged wars to capture and enslave prisoners. They either sold the slaves to Arab traders or kept them on-hand as laborers. Following the arrival of European slavers, human slaves became more valuable, and the coastal tribes of Madagascar took to warring with each other to obtain prisoners for the lucrative slave-trade. Instead of spears and cutlasses, the tribesmen fought with muskets, musket-balls, and gunpowder that they obtained from the Europeans, conducting fierce and brutal wars. On account of their relationship to the pirates, the Betsimisaraka in eastern Madagascar had more firearms than anyone else. They overpowered their neighbors, the Antankarana and Tsimihety, and even raided the Comoro Islands. As the tribe on the west coast with the most connections to the slave trade, the Sakalava people also had access to guns and powder.
Today, the people of Madagascar can be considered as the product of mixing between the first occupants, the vahoaka ntaolo Austronesians (Vazimbaand Vezo) and those arrived later (Hova neo-Austronesians, Persians, Arabs, Africans and Europeans).
Genotypically, the original Austronesian heritage is more or less evenly distributed throughout the island. Researchers have noticed the ""Polynesian motif"" everywhere: an old marker of Austronesian populations from before the great immigration to the islands of Polynesia and Melanesia. This fact would require a starting common home among the Proto-Malagasy vahoaka ntaolo (gone west to Madagascar) and the ancestors of the current Polynesians (left for the Pacific Islands in the East) between 500 BCE – 1 CE."
History of Madagascar,Feudal era (1500–1895),
History of Madagascar,Rise of the great kingdoms,"Those new immigrants of the Middle Ages were a minority in numbers, yet their cultural contributions, political and technological to the neo-Vazimba and neo-Vezo world substantially altered their society and is the cause of the major upheavals of the sixteenth century that led to the Malagasy feudal era.
On the coasts, the integration of the East Asians, Middle Easterns, Bantus and Portuguese led to the establishment of the kingdoms of the Antakarana, Boina, Menabe and Vezo on the west coast, the Mahafaly and Antandroy in the south, and the Antesaka, Antambahoaka, Antemoro, Antanala and Betsimisaraka on the east coast.
In the interior, the struggle for hegemony between the different Neo-Vazimba clans of central highlands, called the Hova by the coastal Neo-Vezo clans, led to the creation of the Merina, Betsileo, Bezanozano, Sihanaka, Tsimihety and Bara kingdoms.
The birth of these kingdoms/tribes essentially altered the political structure of the ancient world of the Vahoaka Ntaolo, but for the most part the common language, customs, traditions, religion and economy was preserved.
Among the Central Kingdoms, the most important were the Betsileo kingdoms (Fandriana, Fisakana, Manandriana, Isandra) to the south, and the Merina kingdoms to the north. These were definitively unified in the early 19th century by Andrianampoinimerina. His son and successor Radama I (reigning 1810–1828) opened his country to foreign influence. With the support of the British, he extended its authority over much of the island. From 1817, the central Merina kingdoms, Betsileo, Bezanozano, and Sihanaka, unified by Radama I were known to the outside world as the Kingdom of Madagascar."
History of Madagascar,Sakalava,"The island's West clan chiefs began to extend their power through trade with their Indian Ocean neighbors, first with Arab, Persian and Somali traders who connected Madagascar with East Africa, the Middle East and India, and later with European slave traders. The wealth created in Madagascar through trade created a state system ruled by powerful regional monarchs known as the Maroserana. These monarchs adopted the cultural traditions of subjects in their territories and expanded their kingdoms. They took on divine status, and new nobility and artisan classes were created. Madagascar functioned as a contact port for the other Swahili seaport city-states such as Sofala, Kilwa, Mombasa and Zanzibar. By the Middle Ages, large chiefdoms began to dominate considerable areas of the island. Among these were the Betsimisaraka alliance of the eastern coast and the Sakalava chiefdoms of the Menabe (centered in what is now the town of Morondava) and of Boina (centered in what is now the provincial capital of Mahajanga). The influence of the Sakalava extended across what are now the provinces of Antsiranana, Mahajanga and Toliara.
The island's chiefs began to extend their power through trade with their Indian Ocean neighbours, notably East Africa, the Middle East and India. Large chiefdoms began to dominate considerable areas of the island. Among these were the Sakalava chiefdoms of the Menabe, centred in what is now the town of Morondava, and of Boina, centered in what is now the provincial capital of Mahajanga (Majunga). The influence of the Sakalava extended across what are now the provinces of Antsiranana, Mahajanga and Toliara.
According to local tradition, the founders of the Sakalava kingdom were Maroseraña (or Maroseranana, ""those who owned many ports"") princes, from the Fiherenana (now Toliara). They quickly subdued the neighbouring princes, starting with the southern ones, in the Mahafaly area. The true founder of Sakalava dominance was Andriamisara; his son Andriandahifotsy (c. 1610–1658) then extended his authority northwards, past the Mangoky River. His two sons, Andriamanetiarivo and Andriamandisoarivo, extended gains further up to the Tsongay region (now Mahajanga). At about that time, the empire's unity starts to split, resulting in a southern kingdom (Menabe) and a northern kingdom (Boina). Further splits resulted, despite continued extension of the Boina princes' reach into the extreme north, in Antankarana country.
The Sakalava rulers of this period are known through the memoirs of Europeans such as Robert Drury, James Cook, Barnvelt (1719), Valentyn (1726)."
History of Madagascar,Merina monarchy,"King Andrianampoinimerina (1785–1810) and his son, Radama I (1810–1828) succeeded in uniting nearly all of Madagascar under Merina rule.  These kings and their successors descended from a line of ancient Merina royalty who ruled the lands of Imerina in the central Highlands of Madagascar since at least the 16th century. Even prior to their eventual domination and unification of the entire island, the political and cultural activities of Merina royalty were to leave an indelible mark on contemporary Malagasy identity.
With the establishment of dominion over the greater part of the Highlands, Andrianampoinimerina became the first Merina monarch to be considered a king of Madagascar.  The island continued to be ruled by a succession of Merina monarchs until the last of them, Ranavalona III, was deposed and exiled to Algeria by French forces who conquered and colonized the island in 1895."
History of Madagascar,King Andrianampoinimerina,"Andrianampoinimerina, grandson of King Andriambelomasina and successor to his uncle King Andrianjafy, successfully reunited the fragmented Merina kingdom through a combination of diplomacy, strategic political marriages and successful military campaigns against rival princes.  Andrianampoinimerina distinguished himself from other kings by codifying laws and supervising the building of dikes and trenches to increase the amount of arable land around his capital at Antananarivo in a successful bid to end the famines that had wracked Imerina for decades. The king ambitiously proclaimed: Ny ranomasina no valapariako (“the sea is the boundary of my rice-field”), and by the time of his death in 1810 he had conquered the Bara and Betsileo highland tribes, laying the groundwork for expansion of his kingdom to the shores of the island."
History of Madagascar,King Radama I (1810–1828),"Andrianampoinimerina's son Radama I (Radama the Great) assumed the throne during a turning-point in European history that had repercussions for Madagascar. With the defeat of Napoléon in 1814/1815, the balance of power in Europe and overseas shifted in Britain's favor. The British, eager to exert control over the trade routes of the Indian Ocean, had captured the islands of Réunion and Mauritius from the French in 1810. Although they returned Réunion to France, they kept Mauritius as a naval base which would maintain trade links throughout the British Empire. Mauritius's governor, in a bid to woo Madagascar from French control, recognized Radama I as King of Madagascar, a diplomatic maneuver meant to underscore the idea of the sovereignty of the island and thus to preclude claims by any European powers.
Radama I signed treaties with the United Kingdom outlawing the slave trade and admitting Protestant missionaries into Madagascar. As a result of these treaties Protestant missionaries from Britain would spread British influence in Madagascar; while outlawing the slave trade would weaken Réunion's economy by depriving the island of slave laborers for France's sugar plantations. In return for outlawing the slave trade, Madagascar received what the treaty called ""The Equivalent"": an annual sum of a thousand dollars in gold, another thousand in silver, stated amounts of gunpowder, flints, and muskets, plus 400 surplus British Army uniforms. The governor of Mauritius also sent military advisers who accompanied and sometimes led Merina soldiers in their battles against the Sakalava and Betsimisaraka. In 1824, having defeated the Betsimisaraka, Radama I declared, ""Today, the whole island is mine! Madagascar has but one master."" The king died in 1828 while leading his army on a punitive expedition against the Betsimisaraka."
History of Madagascar,Queen Ranavalona I (1828–1861),"The 33-year reign of Queen Ranavalona I, the widow of Radama I, was characterized by an increase in the size of the Kingdom of Madagascar as it conquered neighboring states as well as an effort to maintain the cultural and political sovereignty of Madagascar in the face of increasing foreign influence. The queen repudiated the treaties that Radama I had signed with Britain and, in 1835 after issuing a royal edict prohibiting the practice of Christianity in Madagascar, she expelled British missionaries from the island and began persecuting Christian converts who would not renounce their religion. Malagasy Christians would remember this period as ny tany maizina, or ""the time when the land was dark"". During her reign regular warfare, disease, slavery, difficult forced labor and harsh measures of justice
(Tangena ordeal) resulted in a high mortality rate among soldiers and civilians alike during her 33-year reign, with Madagascar's population reducing from 5 million in 1833 to 2.5 million in 1839.
Unbeknownst to the queen, her son and heir, the crown-prince (the future Radama II), attended Roman Catholic masses in secret. The young man grew up under the influence of French nationals in Antananarivo. In 1854, he wrote a letter to Napoléon III inviting France to invade and uplift Madagascar. On 28 June 1855 he signed the Lambert Charter. This document gave Joseph-François Lambert, an enterprising French businessman who had arrived in Madagascar only three weeks before, the exclusive right to develop all minerals, forests, and unoccupied land in Madagascar in exchange for a 10-percent royalty payable to the Merina monarchy. In years to come, the French would show the Lambert Charter and the prince's letter to Napoléon III to explain the Franco-Hova Wars and the annexation of Madagascar as a colony. In 1857, the queen uncovered a plot by her son (the future Radama II) and French nationals in the capital to remove her from power. She immediately expelled all foreigners from Madagascar, sparing her son. Ranavalona died in 1861."
History of Madagascar,King Radama II (1861–1863),"In his brief two years on the throne, King Radama II re-opened trade with Mauritius and Réunion, invited Christian missionaries and foreigners to return to Madagascar, and re-instated most of Radama I's reforms. His liberal policies angered the aristocracy, however, and Rainivoninahitriniony, the prime minister, engineered a coup d'état in which Radama II was strangled to death."
History of Madagascar,Queen Rasoherina (1863–1868),"A council of princes headed by Rainilaiarivony approached Rabodo, the widow of Radama II, the day after the death of her husband.  They gave her the conditions under which she could succeed to the throne.  These conditions included the suppression of trial by ordeal as well as the monarchy's defense of freedom of religion. Rabodo, crowned queen on 13 May 1863 under the throne name of Rasoherina, reigned until her death on 1 April 1868.The Malagasy people remember Queen Rasoherina for sending ambassadors to London and Paris and for prohibiting Sunday markets. On 30 June 1865, she signed a treaty with the United Kingdom giving British citizens the right to rent land and property on the island and to have a resident ambassador. With the United States of America she signed a trade agreement that also limited the importation of weapons and the export of cattle.  Finally, with France the queen signed a peace between her descendants and the descendants of the Emperor of France. Rasoherina married her Prime Minister, Rainivoninahitriniony, but public outcry against his involvement in the murder of Radama II soon forced his resignation and exile to Betsileo country south of Imerina.  She then married his brother, Rainilaiarivony, head of the army at the time of Radama II's murder who was promoted to the post of Prime Minister upon the resignation and exile of his older brother.  Rainilaiarivony would rule Madagascar from behind the scenes for the remaining 32 years of the Merina monarchy, marrying each of the final three queens of Madagascar in succession."
History of Madagascar,Queen Ranavalona II (1868–1883),"In 1869, Queen Ranavalona II, previously educated by the London Missionary Society, underwent baptism into the Church of England and subsequently made the Anglican faith the official state religion of Madagascar.
The queen had all the sampy (traditional royal idols) burned in a public display. Catholic and Protestant missionaries arrived in numbers to build churches and schools. The reign of Queen Ranavalona II proved the high water mark of British influence in Madagascar.  British goods and weapons arrived on the island by way of South Africa."
History of Madagascar,Queen Ranavalona III (1883–1897),Her public coronation as queen took place on 22 November 1883 and she took the name Ranavalona III.  As her first order of business she confirmed the nomination of Rainilaiarivony and his entourage in their positions.  She also promised to do away with the French threat.
History of Madagascar,End of the monarchy,"Angry at the cancellation of the Lambert Charter and seeking to restore property seized from French citizens, France invaded Madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the first Franco-Hova War (Hova as a name referring to the Merina aristocrats). At the war's end, Madagascar ceded Antsiranana (Diégo Suarez) on the northern coast to France and paid 560,000 gold francs to the heirs of Joseph-François Lambert. In Europe, meanwhile, European diplomats had worked out an agreement whereby Britain, in order to establish control over the Sultanate of Zanzibar, ceded its rights over the island of Heligoland to Germany and renounced all claims of influence in Madagascar in favor of France. The agreement spelled the end of the Madagascan political independence. Rainilaiarivony had succeeded in playing the various European powers against one another, but now France could act without fear of British support towards the Madagascans.In 1895, a French flying column landed in Mahajanga (Majunga) and marched by way of the Betsiboka River to the capital, Antananarivo, taking the city's defenders by surprise (they had expected an attack from the much closer east coast). Twenty French soldiers died fighting and 6,000 died of malaria and other diseases before the second Franco-Hova War ended. In 1896 the French Parliament voted to annex Madagascar. The 103-year-old Merina monarchy ended with the royal family sent into exile in Algeria."
History of Madagascar,International recognition and modernization of the Kingdom (1817–1895),"The kingdom of Madagascar continued its transformation throughout the 19th century from a locally grown monarchy into a modern state.
Before Radama I the Malagasy language was written in a script known as sorabe. In 1820 under the direction of David Jones, a Welsh missionary of the London Missionary Society, Radama I codified the new Malagasy Latin alphabet of 21 letters which replaced the old sorabe alphabet. By 1830 the Bible was the first book written in this new Malagasy Latin alphabet. It is the oldest complete translation of the bible into a sub-Saharan African language.
The United States and the Kingdom of Madagascar concluded a commercial convention in 1867 after which Queen Rasoherina and Prime Minister Rainilaiarivoy exchanged gifts with president Andrew Johnson. A treaty of peace, friendship, and commerce was then signed in 1881.During the reign of Ranavalona I, early attempts at industrialization took place from 1835 under the direction of the French Jean Laborde (a survivor of a shipwreck off the east coast), producing soap, porcelain, metal tools and firearms (rifles, cannons, etc.)..
In 1864 Antananarivo opened the first hospital and a modern medical school. Two years later appeared the first newspaper. A scientific journal in English (Antananarivo Annual) was released from 1875. In 1894, on the eve of the establishment of colonial rule, the schools of the kingdom, mainly led by the Protestant missions, were attended by over 200,000 students."
History of Madagascar,French colonization,"In 1750, the ruler of the Kingdom of Betsimisaraka, Bety of Betsimisaraka, ceded the island Nosy Boraha (Île Sainte-Marie) to the Kingdom of France. However, in 1752 the French Colonists were massacred when the local population rebelled. France left the settlement abandoned for roughly half a century until returning in 1818.In 1840 Tsiomeko, the ruler of Nosy Be island, accepted French protection in 1840. The French took possession of the island in 1841, and in 1849 an unsuccessful attempt was made to expel them.In the Berlin Treaty, the British accepted the claims of France to exert its influence on Madagascar, and after the first Franco-Hova Wara treaty of alliance between France and Madagascar was signed on 17 December 1885 by Queen Ranavalona III, granting France a protectorate over the Diego-Suarez bay and surrounding territory, as well as the islands of Nosy-Be and Île Sainte-Marie.
Disagreements on the implementation of this treaty served as a pretext for the French invasion of 1895, which first met little resistance. The authority of the Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony, in power since 1864, had become very unpopular with the public.
The British accepted the imposition of a French protectorate over Madagascar in 1890 in return for recognition of British sovereignty over Zanzibar (subsequently part of Tanzania) and as part of an overall definition of spheres of influence in the area. The intention of the French was initially to maintain the protectorate in order to control the economy and foreign relations of the island. But later, the outbreak of the Menalamba rebellion and the arrival of General Gallieni (responsible for ""pacifying"" the country) in 1896 led to the colonization of the island and the exile of the queen to Algeria.
In 1904–1905 Madagascar was the scene of a large-scale uprising by various tribes and tribal leaders, among whom Kotavy, a former French corporal who defected to the rebels, filled a preponderant role.Malagasy troops fought in France, Morocco, and Syria during World War II. Prior to the implementation of the Final Solution, Nazi Germany had considered the Madagascar Plan, which would have relocated European Jews to Madagascar. After France fell to the Germans in 1940, the Vichy government administered Madagascar until 1942, when British and Commonwealth troops occupied the strategic island in the Battle of Madagascar. The United Kingdom handed over control of the island to Free French Forces in 1943."
History of Madagascar,Revolt and decolonization (1947–1960),"In 1948, with French prestige at a low ebb, the French government, headed by Prime Minister Paul Ramadier of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) party, suppressed the Madagascar revolt, a nationalist uprising.The French subsequently established reformed institutions in 1956 under the Loi Cadre (Overseas Reform Act), and Madagascar moved peacefully toward independence. The Malagasy Republic, proclaimed on 14 October 1958, became an autonomous state within the French Community. On 26 March 1960 France agreed to Madagascar becoming fully independent. On 26 June 1960 Madagascar became an independent country and Philibert Tsiranana became its first president."
History of Madagascar,Independence,
History of Madagascar,First Republic (1960–1972),"Tsiranana's rule represented continuation, with French settlers (or colons) still in positions of power.  Unlike many of France's former colonies, the Malagasy Republic strongly resisted movements towards communism.In 1972, protests against these policies came to a head and Tsiranana had to step down. He handed power to General Gabriel Ramanantsoa of the army and his provisional government. This régime reversed previous policy in favour of closer ties with the Soviet Union.On 5 February 1975, Colonel Richard Ratsimandrava became the President of Madagascar. After six days as head of the country, he died in an assassination while driving from the presidential palace to his home. Political power passed to Gilles Andriamahazo."
History of Madagascar,Second Republic (1972–1991),"On 15 June 1975, Lieutenant-Commander Didier Ratsiraka (who had previously served as foreign minister) came to power in a coup.  Elected president for a seven-year term, Ratsiraka moved further towards socialism, nationalising much of the economy and cutting all ties with France. These policies hastened the decline in the Madagascan economy that had begun after independence as French immigrants left the country, leaving a shortage of skills and technology behind. Ratsiraka's original seven-year term as President continued after his party (Avant-garde de la Révolution Malgache or AREMA) became the only legal party in the 1977 elections.
In the 1980s, Madagascar moved back towards France, abandoning many of its communist-inspired policies in favour of a market economy, though Ratsiraka still kept hold of power.Eventually, opposition, both within and without, forced Ratsiraka to consider his position and in 1992 the country adopted a new and democratic constitution."
History of Madagascar,Third Republic (1991–2002),"The first multi-party elections came in 1993, with Albert Zafy defeating Ratsiraka. Despite being a strong proponent of a liberal, free-market economy, Zafy ran on a ticket critical of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. During his presidency the country struggled to implement IMF and World Bank guidelines that were, on the short term, suicidal politically.As president Zafy was frustrated by the restraints placed upon the powers of his office by the new constitution. His quest for increased executive power put him on a collision course with the parliament led by then Prime Minister Francisque Ravony. Zafy eventually won the power he sought after but suffered impeachment at the hands of the disenfranchised parliament in 1996 for violating the constitution by refusing to promulgate specific laws.The ensuing elections saw a turnout of less than 50% and unexpectedly resulted in the re-election of Didier Ratsiraka.
He moved further towards capitalism. The influence of the IMF and the World Bank led to widespread privatisation.
Opposition to Ratsiraka began to grow again. Opposition parties boycotted provincial elections in 2000, and the 2001 presidential election produced more controversy. The opposition candidate Marc Ravalomanana claimed victory after the first round (in December) but the incumbent rejected this position. In early 2002 supporters of the two sides took to the streets and violent clashes took place. Ravalomanana claimed that fraud had occurred in the polls. After an April recount the High Constitutional Court declared Ravalomanana president. Ratsiraka continued to dispute the result but his opponent gained international recognition, and Ratsiraka had to go into exile in France, though forces loyal to him continued activities in Madagascar."
History of Madagascar,Post-Ratsiraka,"Ravalomanana's I Love Madagascar party achieved overwhelming electoral success in December 2001 and he survived an attempted coup in January 2003. He used his mandate to work closely with the IMF and the World Bank to reform the economy, to end corruption and to realise the country's potential.
Ratsiraka went on trial (in absentia) for embezzlement (the authorities charged him with taking $8m of public money with him into exile) and the court sentenced him to ten years' hard labour.Ravalomanana is credited with improving the country's infrastructure, such as roads, along with making improvements in education and health, but has faced criticism for his lack of progress against poverty; purchasing power is said to have declined during his time in office. On 18 November 2006, his plane was forced to divert from Madagascar's capital during a return trip from Europe following reports of a coup underway in Antananarivo and shooting near the airport; however, this alleged coup attempt was unsuccessful.
Ravalomanana ran for a second term in the presidential election held on December 3, 2006. According to official results, he won the election with 54.79% of the vote in the first round; his best results were in Antananarivo Province, where he received the support of 75.39% of voters. He was sworn in for his second term on January 19, 2007.Ravalomanana dissolved the National Assembly in July 2007, prior to the end of its term, following a constitutional referendum earlier in the year. Ravalomanana said that a new election needed to be held so that the National Assembly would reflect the changes made in this referendum.He became involved in a political standoff after he closed the TV station belonging to Antananarivo mayor Andry Rajoelina. In January 2009, protests which then turned violent were organized and spearheaded by Andry Rajoelina, the mayor of the capital city of Antananarivo and a prominent opponent of President Ravalomanana.The situation fundamentally changed on 10 March 2009 when army leaders forced the recently appointed defense secretary to resign (the previous one had decided to resign after the killings by the presidential guard on 7 February 2009). They also announced that they gave the opponents 72 hours to dialogue and find a solution to the crisis before they would take further action. This move came after the leaders of the main military camp had announced a day earlier that they would not execute orders coming from the presidency any more since their duty was to protect the people, and not to oppress them, as groups of the military had done over the last few days.On 16 March 2009, the army seized the presidential palace in the centre of Antananarivo. Ravalomanana was not in the palace at the time. He handed his resignation to the army, which then decided to hand over power to his fierce political rival, Andry Rajoelina. The second round of the postponed presidential elections was held in December 2013 and the results were announced in January 2014. The winner and the next president was Hery Rajaonarimampianina. He was backed by Rajoelina who led the 2009 coup and still was very influential political figure.In 2018 the first round of the presidential election was held on 7 November and the second round was held on 10 December. Three former presidents and the most recent president were the main candidates of the elections. Former president Andry Rajoelina won the second round of the elections. He was previously president from 2009 to 2014. Former president Marc Ravalomana lost the second round and he did not accept the results because of allegations of fraud. Ravalomana was president from 2002 to 2009. The most recent president Hery Rajaonarimampianina received very modest support in the first round. In January 2019 the High Constitutional Court declared Rajoelina as the winner of the elections and the new president.In 2019, an epidemic of measles killed 1,200 people.In 2021, Madagascar's worst drought in 40 years left more than a million people in southern Madagascar food insecure. This forced thousands of people to leave their homes to search for food."

Cimarron (1931 film),Plot,"The Oklahoma land rush of 1889 prompts thousands to travel to the Oklahoma Territory to grab free government land; Yancey Cravat (Richard Dix) and his young bride, Sabra (Irene Dunne) cross the border from Kansas to join the throngs. In the ensuing race, Yancey is outwitted by a young prostitute, Dixie Lee (Estelle Taylor), who takes the prime piece of real estate, the Bear Creek claim, that Yancey had targeted for himself.
His plans for establishing a ranch thwarted, Yancey moves into the town of Osage, a boomer town, where he confronts and kills Lon Yountis (Stanley Fields), an outlaw who had killed the prior publisher of the local newspaper. Having a background in publishing himself, Yancey establishes the Oklahoma Wigwam, a weekly newspaper, to help turn the frontier camp into a respectable town. After the birth of their daughter, Donna, a gang of outlaws threatens Osage, led by ""The Kid"" (William Collier Jr.), who happens to be an old acquaintance of Yancey's. To save the town, Yancey faces and kills The Kid.
Beset by guilt over his killing of The Kid, when another land rush appears, Yancey leaves Sabra and his children to participate in settling the Cherokee Strip. After his departure, Sabra takes over the publication of the Oklahoma Wigwam, and raises her children until Yancey returns five years later, just in time to represent Dixie Lee, who had been charged with being a public nuisance, and win her acquittal.
Osage continues to grow, as does the Territory of Oklahoma, which gains statehood in 1907 and benefits from the early oil boom of the 1900s, including the Native American tribes, that Yancey supports, through editorials in his newspaper, after which Yancey once again disappears from Osage for several years. At the time, Sabra is vehemently anti-Native American, despite her son's involvement with an Indian woman. Years later, when Sabra becomes the first female member of Congress from the state of Oklahoma, she lauds the virtues of her by-then Indian daughter-in-law.
Sabra and Yancey are reunited one final time when she rushes to his side after he has rescued numerous oil drillers from a devastating explosion. He dies in her arms."

Cimarron (1931 film),Production,"Despite being in the depths of the Great Depression, RKO Radio Pictures invested more than $1.5 million into production of Ferber's novel. Filming began in the summer of 1930 at Jasmin Quinn Ranch outside of Los Angeles, California, where the land rush scenes were shot. More than twenty-eight cameramen, and numerous camera assistants and photographers, were used to capture scenes of more than 5,000 costumed extras, covered wagons, buckboards, surreys, and bicyclists as they raced across grassy hills and prairie to stake their claim. Cinematographer Edward Cronjager planned out every take (that recalled the scenes of Intolerance some fifteen years earlier) in accordance with Ferber's descriptions. In order to film key scenes for this production, RKO purchased 89 acres in Encino where construction of Art Director Max Ree's Oscar-winning design of a complete western town and a three-block modern main street were built to represent the fictional Oklahoma boomtown of Osage. These award-winning sets eventually formed the nucleus of RKO's expansive movie ranch, in Encino, where other RKO (and non-RKO) films were later shot."
Cimarron (1931 film),Reception,
Cimarron (1931 film),Contemporary reviews,"RKO Radio Pictures premiered Cimarron at the RKO Palace Theatre (Broadway) in New York City on January 26, 1931, to much praise, and then on February 6 a Los Angeles Orpheum Theatre premiere followed, that also included personal appearances of Richard Dix and Irene Dunne, a stage show and an augmented orchestra. Three days later, the movie was released to theaters throughout the nation. Despite being a critical success, the extremely high budget and ongoing Depression combined against the film. While it was a commercial success in line with other films of the day, RKO Pictures could not at first recoup their heavy investment in the film, that ended up losing $565,000. However, it recouped some more money on a 1935 re-release that enjoyed another premiere in Oklahoma City at the (John Eberson designed) Midwest Theatre. The movie remained RKO's most expensive film until 1939's Gunga Din (that filmed exteriors around the Sierra Nevada Alabama Hills range, but had one scene shot on RKO's movie ranch in Encino).Reviews by film critics were overwhelmingly positive at the time. Variety led off its review with, ""An elegant example of super film making and a big money picture. This is a spectacular western away from all others. It holds action, sentiment, sympathy, thrills and comedy – and 100% clean. Radio Pictures has a corker in 'Cimarron'."" The review went on to praise the actors, particularly Dix and Oliver, as well as the direction, stating, ""Wesley Ruggles apparently gets the full credit for this splendid and heavy production. His direction misses nothing in the elaborate scenes, as well as in the usual film making procedure."" The magazine specifically pointed out the quality of the make-up in the aging of the principle players, who have to go through forty years on-screen.Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times also gave the film a stellar review, calling it, ""A graphic and engrossing screen conception of Edna Ferber's widely read novel ..."", and also praised the handling of the passage of time in this epic. Hall also singled out the performance of Dunne. Motion Picture Magazine raved, ""A great and worthy effort, this transcription of early Oklahoma life will be hailed as one of the high-spots of the year. It has everything. RKO seems to have placed no restrictions upon making it a lavish, bona-fide epic.""John Mosher of The New Yorker praised the ""great care"" that had been taken with the historical accuracy of the film's visual details, that he thought ""as good as anything that has come out of Hollywood, and because of this expertness the film gains especial value"". He also wrote that Richard Dix was ""certainly at his best in this role"". His only criticisms concerned the second half of the film, that he thought had ""sagging moments"" and an ending that was too abrupt. The Evening Independent called it ""a notable addition to the small list of pictures that the years have given to the American theater. For in Cimarron is vested stirring drama, stark beauty, daring and adventure on a plane that is seldom seen on the screen."" The West Seattle Herald declared that it was ""even more powerful than the great story read by millions in America. Cimarron the picture is all that is gripping in Cimarron the story. Spectacular scenes abound in this production.""Elizabeth Yeaman of the Hollywood Daily Citizen saw the film as a new type of history, writing that, “Like history, the picture has moments of thrilling glory and moments of repetition and daily routine. Cimarron does not follow the rules of story construction... It is, in short, a graphic interpretation of a portion of history, the history of the state of Oklahoma from the time of the first great land rush until the present.”"
Cimarron (1931 film),Retrospective reviews,"More recent appraisals of the film have not been as positive. Cimarron currently holds a ""Rotten"" 52% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 31 reviews, with a weighted average of 4.9/10. The site's consensus reads: ""Cimarron is supported by a strong performance from Irene Dunne, but uneven in basically every other regard, and riddled with potentially offensive stereotypes.""Assessing the film in 2009, James Berardinelli called it ""an excellent study of how tastes have changed over the years. Critically lauded at the time of its release, Cimarron was beloved by most who saw it. Eight decades later, it is frequently cited on lists of the most undeserving Academy Award winners and is rightfully impugned for racist overtones and scattershot storytelling.""Steve Evans of DVD Verdict wrote, ""Seen with contemporary eyes, the film is badly dated, slow moving, and pocked with racist caricatures....The recreation of the great 1889 Oklahoma Land Rush remains an exciting spectacle....Unfortunately, the film never manages to top this opening shot."""
Cimarron (1931 film),Awards and honors,"At the 1931 Academy Awards ceremony at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, Cimarron was the first film to receive more than six Academy Awards nominations and be nominated for the Big Five awards (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Writing). Additionally, it is one of only two films (the other being Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?) to receive nominations in every eligible category. It won for three of them, including Best Picture.  It would win the first of only two Best Picture Oscars for the studio, the other being awarded to 1946's The Best Years of Our Lives. It was the first Western to win the Best Picture award, and remained the only Western genre film with that honor until 1990, when Dances with Wolves won.1930–1931 Academy Awards"

Princess Bride Reunion,Origin of event,"The idea to recruit Princess Bride cast members for a fundraiser was inspired by a benefit event organized by Wisconsin Democrats that reunited cast members of The West Wing. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Cary Elwes (Westley in the film) approached a friend who knew Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin to ask if he could help raise money for the battleground state. Wisconsin Democrats and others promoted the virtual script reading with digital ads and social media. Elwes began teasing the event in his Twitter feed in early September 2020, announcing it openly on September 4:#Inconceivable! I’m excited to announce a virtual #PrincessBrideReunion! Chip in any amount at the link & get an invite to this special event on Sun. Sept. 13th with myself, @RealRobinWright, @PatinkinMandy, @robreiner & many more! #DumpTrumperdinck.
Wisconsin was considered an important ""swing state"" in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. In 2016, Donald Trump won the state, despite consistent polls that showed Hillary Clinton ahead. The police shooting of Jacob Blake in August 2020, followed by the fatal shooting of two protestors, also created political tension in Wisconsin.Senator Ted Cruz, responding to the event announcement on Twitter, said that he wished the Princess Bride movie, which he called ""perfect,"" would stay out of ""Hollywood politics"". Widespread news coverage of Cruz's criticism, and of pushback from the cast, ""led to a surge of publicity,"" according to The New Yorker."
Princess Bride Reunion,Cast,"Although most of the original actors volunteered for the fundraiser, Deadline Hollywood announced on September 9 that there would be several replacements and additions. The replacements included Whoopi Goldberg (playing more than one part), Eric Idle (playing The Impressive Clergyman), and Josh Gad (playing Fezzik). Grandpa and The Narrator, two roles originated by Peter Falk (who died in 2011) were taken by Rob Reiner and Jason Reitman.  Norman Lear joined the Q&A session at the end, which was hosted by Patton Oswalt. Fred Savage was unable to join the event because it conflicted with his brother's birthday.The 2020 event featured:"
Princess Bride Reunion,Framing story,"Jason Reitman as The Narrator (played by Peter Falk in the movie)
Rob Reiner as Grandpa (played by Peter Falk in the movie)
Finn Wolfhard as The Grandson (played by Fred Savage in the movie)
Whoopi Goldberg as The Mother (played by Betsy Brantley in the movie)"
Princess Bride Reunion,Main story,"Cary Elwes as Westley/Dread Pirate Roberts/The Man in Black
Robin Wright as Buttercup/The Princess Bride
Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya
Chris Sarandon as Prince Humperdinck
Christopher Guest as Count Tyrone Rugen
Wallace Shawn as Vizzini
Josh Gad as Fezzik (played by André the Giant in the movie)
Billy Crystal as Miracle Max

Princess Bride Reunion,Additions to the original,"Patton Oswalt served as MC and hosted the Q&A session afterward.
Ben Wikler spoke on behalf of Wisconsin Democrats."
Princess Bride Reunion,Performance,"After some technical problems that delayed the performance, Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Ben Wikler thanked the audience for supporting Democrats. Although 2020 polling showed Joe Biden ahead of Donald Trump in Wisconsin, Wikler noted that Trump won Wisconsin in 2016 despite trailing in polls throughout that campaign.To set the scene, Jason Reitman read the screenplay's stage directions in addition to reading the role of The Narrator. A few performers had transient audio problems, and King Bach did not appear due to technical problems. Finn Wolfhard read Bach's parts, as well as  The Grandson. The actors were filmed individually in their homes, as was common in 2020 due to Coronavirus. Most wore ordinary street clothing and read without props, although Mandy Patinkin and Billy Crystal used some of their props from the film.After the readthrough, Patton Oswalt moderated a Q&A session with questions from the online audience. Norman Lear, the film's producer, said there were no plans to remake the movie but that he hoped to see a musical version some day."
Princess Bride Reunion,Reception and aftermath,"Though live and not perfect, the table-reading received positive reviews. The A.V. Club mentioned ""the obvious love and enthusiasm with which every member of the cast, original or otherwise, brought to this event,"" but singled out Mandy Patinkin for special praise. Listing ""11 delights"" from the event, they mentioned Josh Gad's ""surprisingly moving Andre the Giant tribute,"" Billy Crystal's homemade ""Miracle Max"" set, and ""basically everything involving Mandy Patinkin.""According to Rolling Stone, ""highlights included Elwes donning a medical mask for the line 'It’s just that masks are terribly comfortable — I think everyone will be wearing them in the future' and Patinkin’s entire performance.""
The New Yorker also singled out Patinkin, and his dramatic introduction of Inigo Montoya's six-fingered sword:...he threw himself into his old role with a passion that seemed to sear the lens of his Webcam. He roared, he wept, he danced; he rolled his 'R's and sharpened his 'E's; he even came in costume—a white shirt, rakishly unbuttoned to mid-chest. At the moment of the story’s first marvelous duel, when Montoya introduces his sword, Patinkin presented—to considerable excitement in my household (and on Twitter, where my feed was briefly overwhelmed by exclamation marks and the word “sword”)—an actual prop sword from the film itself.
Entertainment Weekly noted many viewer comments on the ""Miracle Max"" background Billy Crystal had created (he also wore his original hat from the film.) They also enjoyed the Q&A session, including the cast's memories of Andre the Giant.More than 110,000 listeners donated $1 or more to be able to tune in to the event, which raised $4.25 million for Wisconsin Democrats. On September 18, the Associated Press updated earlier numbers to say that more than 142,000 viewers made donations, bringing the amount raised to $4.26 million. Wikler said of the event that it was the biggest grassroots fundraiser the party has ever held.Trump campaign spokespeople, however, said that the online event would not help Biden win Wisconsin. Trump's spokeswoman Anna Kelly said, ""Unlike the movie, we know what inconceivable means, and a Biden victory in Wisconsin is simply inconceivable"". Mr Biden would go on win the state by 20,697 votes, according to the final ballot count.
Elwes, being interviewed on Morning Joe on September 17, said that following the success of the reunion, other battleground states  approached him about doing table reads of other classic movies. By October 31, according to The Washington Post, the Princess Bride table-readpropelled an unprecedented run of virtual cast reunions...The flurry of Democratic fundraising cast reunions and readings in recent months has included Veep, Seinfeld, Parks and Recreation, Happy Days and Superbad...
A recording of the live performance can be accessed using a passcode, in exchange for a donation to Wisconsin Democrats.

WMML,History,"What is now WMML began operations in 1959 as WSET, programming a middle of the road format; for a time, the station studios were located in the Queensbury Hotel in Glens Falls. In 1965, WSET changed its call letters to WBZA; the new call letters arose from the station owner's respect for WBZ in Boston. At the time, the station broadcast at 1410 AM with a ""daytime only"" license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  At sunset each day, the station would leave the air until the next day at 6 a.m. In 1971, the format was changed to Top 40. During the later 1970s, WBZA evolved to more of an adult contemporary format, and it eventually changed frequencies to 1230 in late 1982. WBZA flipped formats in 1986 to nostalgia, calling itself ""Real Music"". The WBZA call letters were transferred 1410 AM (which had returned to the air in 1988 under a new license as WSTL) in 1998; at that time, the station changed its call letters to WMML and took on a sports format.

The station signed off the air in early 2012 to build a new antenna and returned to the air in March.  It was announced, when the station signed back on March 15, that WMML would be joining the New York Mets Radio Network, covering all 162 games, replacing WOFX, who decided to switch to the Boston Red Sox Radio Network for the 2012 season.On March 9, 2023, WMML/W250CC flipped to classic country, assuming the format and branding of WKBE, as ""Big Country 97.9""; this is intended to make room for a new format to debut on WKBE. After weeks of broadcasting on both 107.1 and 97.9 for, WKLI began simulcasting on WKBE as ""100.9/107.1 The Cat"" on March 21, 2023."

Litton Industries bombing,Litton Industries' role,"Litton Industries was conceived as a radio-engineering firm in 1934, but was purchased by Charles Bates Thornton, a Pentagon official with ""all the right connections in the government and military"", in 1956. Litton transformed into a military producer, building entire naval ships in their private shipyards, and installing their privately produced equipment, including communications and navigation systems.Described as ""the best known economic link between Canada and the nuclear arms race"", Litton Industries' Rexdale plant was announced in October 1978 as one of two locations in the world that would be responsible for the manufacture of Terrain Contour Matching (TERCOM) guidance systems of the American Tomahawk cruise missile. The Canadian federal government had given Litton a $26.4 million grant, in addition to a $22.5 million interest-free loan specifically to allow them to bid competitively for the contract, drawing complaints from some members of the public for using federal funds to further the arms race. The American contract called for approximately 407 cruise missiles to be fitted with navigation systems by Litton Canada."
Litton Industries bombing,Planning,"On the night of July 27, 1982, a British Columbia Department of Highways explosives storehouse north of Squamish was entered, and 38½ cases of dynamite were stolen. On September 13, a local hunter came upon two camouflaged and locked wooden structures that had been built in the forests of Garibaldi, near the site of the theft. One contained four reels of detonating cord and three boxes of electronic blasting caps, and the other building held 28½ cases of dynamite as well as explosive gelatin. This indicates that ten crates of dynamite were not stored in the wooden structures, to which Direct Action members Brent Taylor and Ann Hansen held keys.The three associates stole a GMC van in the Greater Toronto Area on September 30, as well as an Oldsmobile and Chevrolet Chevelle three and four nights later respectively.On the morning of October 14, just hours before the bombing, the Ontario Court of Appeals ruled that five Litton executives from the plant could not be called to testify by the defence counsel of 22 anti-nuclear activists who had been arrested for trespassing one year earlier."
Litton Industries bombing,Execution of the bombing,"The bombing was carried out on October 14, 1982, using a van that was parked in a location partially concealed by shrubs, with a fluorescent ""warning box"" duct taped to the hood, displaying a message, a digital clock counting down, and a single stick of dynamite.

DANGER EXPLOSIVES - Inside this van are 550 lbs. of commercial dynamite which will explode anytime from within 15 minutes to 25 minutes after the van was parked here. The dynamite will be set off by two completely separate detonating systems. Do not enter or move the van - it will explode. Phone the police immediately and have them block off Highway 27, Cityview Drive, Dixon Road and other roads surrounding the Litton plants and have the workers inside the plants moved to protected areas. Nearby hotels and factories should also be notified so that no one will be hurt by the blast. On top of this box is an authentic sample stick of the dynamite contained inside the van. This is to confirm that this is a real bomb.
Belmas called the security desk and warned them that a dynamite bomb was placed in a van outside the building, and that it would detonate ""in 15 to 20 minutes"". She also told the guards to evacuate the plant, phone the local hotels to warn guests to stay away from windows to avoid injury and to have police close down passing roadways to limit the damage to Litton Industries.

... And it will explode in 15 to 20 minutes. Do not enter or move the van because it will explode. This is no prank. We have left for you on the lawn beside the van a box, which is not dangerous. Taped to the box are further instructions and a stick of the same dynamite that we have used in the bomb. This should be ample evidence in confirming to you the severity of our attack. Act immediately to phone the police and have them block off traffic from Cityview drive, Highway 27, Dixon Road and other surrounding areas. Move all the workers from all of your plants to protected areas and notify the surrounding hotels to have people stay away from all windows. I want to be sure that you understand what I just said. Could you repeat the crucial information to me?
The bomb detonated 11 minutes after the phone call. Speculation by local police constable Mitchell of the Toronto bomb squad three weeks after the bombing proposed that if responding officers had used radios, their use may possibly have triggered the detonation early.  A representative of Litton also confirmed that radios were used during the evacuation of the plant.The explosion injured three members of the police, three passing motorists and five Litton employees, blowing out a 50-foot section of wall on the main two-story plant, and damaging two adjacent buildings. The cost of damages was described by police as being ""in the millions"". Damages were estimated anywhere from $3.87 million to $50 million.On October 19, a 9-page communique was mailed to various organisations and media outlets. The first six pages were titled ""Direct Action"" and explained the philosophy of the group's actions. The remaining three pages were titled ""Statement regarding the October 14 Litton Bombing"" and included an explanation of the purpose of the bombing, as well as an apology for the injuries."
Litton Industries bombing,Aftermath,"Although Litton Industries indicated that the bombing had not slowed production by more than a week, the bombing was hailed as a ""massive success"" by the anarchist movement who saw it as ""an act of sabotage"" against the American military machine. Although there was not wide public support for the bombing, Ann Hansen later pointed to the fact that 15,000 people attended a ""Refuse the Cruise"" demonstration two weeks after the bombing as evidence it had forced the public to confront Canada's role in the military–industrial complex. Others have concurred that the bombing did galvanize the population, who viewed the bombing as controversial or unnecessary, but took to the streets in greatly strengthened numbers to protest Canada complicity in the production of instruments of war. A month after the bombing, 700 people showed up at the Litton Industries plant to engage in ""civil disobedience"" despite police warnings.In a statement following the event, Litton President Ronald Keating said, ""Bombing is madness!"" Organizers ridiculed this statement as hypocritical, considering Litton's nature as a defense contractor. Following the bombing, Litton increased their security budget by $2 million, money that Keating said ""was money which could be put into our business to help make us more competitive"".The day after the bombing, an anonymous male telephoned Garrett Manufacturing, another defense contractor housed several blocks away in the same Toronto neighbourhood, to report that a bomb had been placed in the building; leading to an evacuation of the 15 personnel on-shift.Two years later on the second anniversary of the action, the Belgian Cellules Communistes Combattantes (English: Communist Combat Cells) bombed Litton buildings situated in Evere, Brussels. A communique by the CCC claimed the attack for similar reasons to Direct Action, describing Litton as  'the designer, manufacturer and producer of the Cruise missile guidance system whose installation preparations are well underway on the site of the Florennes military base"". It was the first claimed attack of the CCC's two year campaign. 
16 years later, due to purely financial considerations, Litton Industries lost their government contract to build the navigation systems to Kearfott Guidance & Navigation."
Litton Industries bombing,Investigation,"Sgt. William Deconkey, of the Toronto Police, was put in charge of the investigation; and was said to have accepted offers from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Central Intelligence Agency to help ""hunt the terrorists"".In the days following the bombing, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police obtained approval for a 90-day Level IV operation against the Cruise Missile Conversion Project (CMPC), intended to determine the level of influence among known ""subversives"". The telephones of CMPC members, including Ken Hancock, were wiretapped for ""some considerable time"" according to Roy McMurtry, the Attorney General of Ontario. Hancock was also the subject of a police raid that seized four bags of documents, after his name surfaced in the diary of Ivan LeCouvie, another man who was arrested and then released by police."
Litton Industries bombing,Trials,"Taylor, hailed as the ""intellectual leader of the group"" due to having written about the philosophy of guerrilla tactics and revolution, was sentenced to 9 years for the Litton bombing, to be served concurrently with the 22-year sentence he received for conspiracy to rob an armoured bank truck. Hansen, pleading guilty, was sentenced to 12 years for the Litton bombing, to be served concurrently with her life sentence for conspiracy to rob the bank truck, her six years for the bombing of the power station and several other mixed sentences for the firebombing of the pornography stores in Vancouver. Gerry Hannah and Doug Stewart, although sentenced to six and ten years respectively for other Direct Action activities, were not convicted of playing any role in the Litton bombing.Some defenders of the group have suggested that the accused plead guilty to ensure the trial was not about who committed the action, but ""to turn the trials into a political showcase, trotting out the evils of nuclear power, pornography and cruise missiles for all to see"".The judge ruled that Hansen's life sentence was merited because ""her only remorse or regret is for the injury she caused the ten Litton Systems victims"" and that she did not apologise for any of the group's property damage.In arriving at the sentencing for the group, the judge declared:

I have no doubt that all of these people are well-motivated people working, if not struggling, against unfavourable odds to promote their respective causes... but the message must be crystal clear. Our Canadian way of life will not tolerate the use of fire, explosive substances or weapons as a means to furthering even worthy objectives."

Because of his excellent technique he was called ""Brasilianer"", Brazilian. From 1959 until 1963 he appeared in 69 Oberliga matches, netting 17 goals and contributed to the runner-up titles in 1961 and 1962 in the Oberliga Süd. In the 1963 founded Bundesliga he gathered 46 goals in 113 matches.  In the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, Solz experienced international flair in 1964–65 and 1966–67.

Full-time job,Overview,"Full-time employment often comes with benefits that are not typically offered to part-time, temporary, or flexible workers, such as annual leave, sick leave, and health insurance. Part-time jobs are mistakenly thought by some to not be careers. However, legislation exists to stop employers from discriminating against part-time workers so this should not be a factor when making decisions on career advancement. They generally pay more than part-time jobs per hour, and this is similarly discriminatory if the pay decision is based on part-time status as a primary factor. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer (US Department of Labor). The definition by the employer can vary and is generally published in a company's Employee Handbook. Companies commonly require from 32 to 40 hours per week to be defined as full-time and therefore eligible for benefits.
Full-time status varies between company and is often based on the shift the employee must work during each workweek. The ""standard"" work week consists of five eight-hour days, commonly served between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM or 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM totaling 40 hours. While a four-day week generally consists of four ten-hour days, it may also consist of as little as nine hours for a total of a 36-hour workweek. Twelve-hour shifts are often three days per week, unless the company has the intention of paying out the employee overtime. Overtime is legally paid out anytime an employee works more than 40 hours per week. The legal minimum for overtime starts at Base Pay + One-Half. The increased payout is considered to compensate slightly for the increased fatigue which a person experiences on such long shifts. Shifts can also be very irregular, as in retail, but are still full-time if the required number of hours is reached. There are some situations where a person who needs full-time work is dropped to part-time, which is sometimes a form of constructive dismissal to avoid paying unemployment benefits to a laid-off worker."
Full-time job,Definitions by country,"Full-time workweeks:

 Australia: approximately 38 hours
 Belgium: 38 hours
 Brazil: 40–44 hours
 Chile: 45 hours
 Canada: 37.5 hours - 40.0 hours
 Denmark: 37 hours
 France: 35 hours (government-mandated)
 Germany: 35–40 hours
 Iceland: 40 hours
 India: 48 hours (as per the Factories Act 1948, a person cannot work for more than 48 hours in a week)
 Taiwan: 40 hours
 Israel: 43 hours
 Italy: 40 hours
 Netherlands: 35–40 hours
 Norway: 40 hours (often regulated to 37.5 excl. lunch break)
 Poland: 40 hours
 Russia: 40 hours
 Sweden: 40 hours (not formally defined)
 Turkey: 45 hours (not formally defined)
 United Kingdom: 35 hours (not formally defined), 37.5 hours, or 40 hours contracts are all commonplace.
 United States: 30 hours or more, according to the definitions in the Affordable Care Act. ""The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer."" The FLSA does, however, define the eight-hour day and thus sets the maximum workweek at 40 hours, but provides that employees working beyond 40 hours a week receive additional overtime bonus salaries. However, in practice, only 42% of employees work 40-hour weeks. The average workweek for full-time employees is 47 hours. Increasingly, employers are offering compressed work schedules to employees. Some government and corporate employees now work a 9/80 work schedule (80 hours over 9 days during a two-week period)—commonly 9-hour days Monday to Thursday, 8 hours on one Friday, and off the following Friday.A person working more than full-time is working overtime, and may be entitled to extra per-hour wages (but not salary)."
Full-time job,Academic usage,"“Full-time” can also be used in reference to a student (usually in higher education) who takes a full load of course work each academic term. The distinction between a full-time and part-time student varies markedly from country to country. As an example, in the United States a student is commonly defined as being in full-time education when they undertake 12 or more credit hours. This translates to 12 ""hours"" (often of 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes each) in class per week. ""Lab hours"" often count for less, only as one-half or one-third of a credit hour.
International students must maintain full-time status for student visas. Adult students (typically up to age 22 or 23) may also fall under their parents' health insurance (and possibly car insurance and other services) if they are full-time, except for one term per year (usually summer). Students may also be eligible for elected office in student government or other student organizations only if they are full-time. The Department of Labor has a full-time student program which allows employers to pay no less than 85% of the minimum wage to the student/employee."

Jim Eaglestone,Career,"Eaglestone was drawn to cricket after leaving school in 1938 when he joined the groundstaff at Lord's Cricket Ground. He played for the Middlesex Second XI that year. A left-handed batsman, Eaglestone enjoyed limited success after a promising debut first-class game for the Marylebone Cricket Club in which he scored 77 in a 128-run partnership with Denis Compton. Having securing selection for Middlesex, he scored zero in his first outing for the county side, and though he made 55 in his next game he would score only seven half-centuries during his career and finish with a batting average of 15.77.Eaglestone played only seven matches for Middlesex in that solitary season for the club, scoring 151 runs. He decided to move to Glamorgan at the end of that year's County Championship – of which Middlesex were crowned champions. He played for Glamorgan in the 1948 season, and Glamorgan were victorious in that year's County Championship also – their maiden County Championship victory. This meant that Eaglestone had featured in Championship winning teams for two successive summers. His own contributions, however, were relatively modest. He scored 595 runs at 18.59 in the 1948 season and 341 runs at 11.36 in 1949.Eaglestone was acknowledged as a highly skilled and valued fielder. Wilf Wooller, his Glamorgan captain, noted his fearless fielding close to the wicket. Wisden in their obituary of Eaglestone praised his ""razor-sharp fielding"" and claimed that ""it was Jimmy's abilities in the field that largely won him a regular place"", and with his inclusion ""Glamorgan could boast having the finest fielding side in the country"".Eaglestone retired from the game in 1949 to run a newsagent's in Paddington, London. His death in 2000 followed a short illness."

En route, she drove off German submarine U-518 after it had torpedoed SS George Ade 125 nautical miles (232 km; 144 mi) off Wilmington, North Carolina, 12 September. Later operations for the minesweeper ranged from Portland, Maine, where she trained with friendly submarines in October, to Cape Charles, Virginia, where she planted small mines, to Port Royal, Bermuda, to which she escorted Keawah and Sapelo in December.
Project continued Atlantic Ocean coast operations during the first half of 1945 but in July proceeded via the Panama Canal Zone to San Pedro, California.  Engaging in minesweeping operations off California in August, the ship steamed to Pearl Harbor the 24th and on to Eniwetok and Saipan in September. After stopping at Buckner Bay, she reached Japan on the 20th. She remained in Japanese waters in connection with Japanese minesweeping activity and to make exploratory sweeps in the Omai Saki area.
Project was decommissioned, 13 June 1946 at Subic Bay, Philippines, and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 16 September 1947. She was transferred to the Philippines on 24 May 1948 as RPS Samar (M-33). She was later reclassified as a patrol corvette with pennant number of PS-33. She was stricken in 1960. Her ultimate fate is not reported in secondary sources."

Adaptation (eye),Efficiency,"The human eye can function from very dark to very bright levels of light; its sensing capabilities reach across nine orders of magnitude. This means that the brightest and the darkest light signal that the eye can sense are a factor of roughly 1,000,000,000 apart. However, in any given moment of time, the eye can only sense a contrast ratio of 1,000. What enables the wider reach is that the eye adapts its definition of what is black.
The eye takes approximately 20–30 minutes to fully adapt from bright sunlight to complete darkness and becomes 10,000 to 1,000,000 times more sensitive than at full daylight. In this process, the eye's perception of color changes as well (this is called the Purkinje effect). However, it takes approximately five minutes for the eye to adapt from darkness to bright sunlight. This is due to cones obtaining more sensitivity when first entering the dark for the first five minutes but the rods taking over after five or more minutes. Cone cells are able to regain maximum retinal sensitivity in 9–10 minutes of darkness whereas rods require 30–45 minutes to do so.Dark adaptation is far quicker and deeper in young people than the elderly."
Adaptation (eye),Cones vs. rods,"The human eye contains three types of photoreceptors, rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Rods and cones are responsible for vision and connected to the visual cortex. ipRGCs are more connected to body clock functions and other parts of the brain but not the visual cortex. Rods and cones can be easily distinguished by their structure. Cone photoreceptors are conical in shape and contain cone opsins as their visual pigments. There exist three types of cone photoreceptors, each being maximally sensitive to a specific wavelength of light depending on the structure of their opsin photopigment. The various cone cells are maximally sensitive to either short wavelengths (blue light), medium wavelengths (green light), or long wavelengths (red light). Rod photoreceptors only contain one type of photopigment, rhodopsin, which has a peak sensitivity at a wavelength of approximately 530 nanometers which corresponds to blue-green light.
The distribution of photoreceptor cells across the surface of the retina has important consequences for vision. Cone photoreceptors are concentrated in a depression in the center of the retina known as the fovea centralis and decrease in number towards the periphery of the retina. Conversely, rod photoreceptors are present at high density throughout the most of the retina with a sharp decline in the fovea. Perception in high luminescence settings is dominated by cones despite the fact that they are greatly outnumbered by rods (approximately 4.5 million to 91 million)."
Adaptation (eye),Ambient light response,"A minor mechanism of adaptation is the pupillary light reflex, adjusting the amount of light that reaches the retina very quickly by about a factor of ten. Since it contributes only a tiny fraction of the overall adaptation to light it is not further considered here.
In response to varying ambient light levels, rods and cones of eye function both in isolation and in tandem to adjust the visual system. Changes in the sensitivity of rods and cones in the eye are the major contributors to dark adaptation.
Above a certain luminance level (about 0.03 cd/m2), the cone mechanism is involved in mediating vision; photopic vision. Below this level, the rod mechanism comes into play providing scotopic (night) vision. The range where two mechanisms are working together is called the mesopic range, as there is not an abrupt transition between the two mechanism. This adaptation forms the basis of the Duplicity Theory."
Adaptation (eye),Advantages of night vision,"Many animals such as cats possess high-resolution night vision, allowing them to discriminate objects with high frequencies in low illumination settings. The tapetum lucidum is a reflective structure that is responsible for this superior night vision as it mirrors light back through the retina exposing the photoreceptor cells to an increased amount of light. Most animals which possess a tapetum lucidum are nocturnal most likely because upon reflection of light back through the retina the initial images become blurred. Humans, like their primate relatives, do not possess a tapetum lucidum and therefore were predisposed to be a diurnal species.Despite the fact that the resolution of human day vision is far superior to that of night vision, human night vision provides many advantages. Like many predatory animals humans can use their night vision to prey upon and ambush other animals without their awareness. Furthermore, in the event of an emergency situation occurring at night humans can increase their chances of survival if they are able to perceive their surroundings and get to safety. Both of these benefits can be used to explain why humans did not completely lose the ability to see in the dark from their nocturnal ancestors."
Adaptation (eye),Dark adaptation,"Rhodopsin, a biological pigment in the photoreceptors of the retina, immediately photobleaches in response to light. Visual phototransduction starts with the isomerizing of the pigment chromophore from 11-cis to all-trans retinal. Then this pigment dissociates into free opsin and all-trans retinal. Dark adaptation of both rods and cones requires the regeneration of the visual pigment from opsin and 11-cis retinal. Therefore, the time required for dark adaptation and pigment regeneration is largely determined by the local concentration of 11-cis retinal and the rate at which it is delivered to the opsin in the bleached rods. The decrease in calcium ion influx after channel closing causes phosphorylation of metarhodopsin II and speeds up the cis-retinal to trans-retinal inactivation. The phosphorylation of activated rhodopsin is mediated by recoverin. The regeneration of the photopigments occurs during dark adaptation albeit at markedly different rates. Rods are more sensitive to light and so take longer to fully adapt to the change in light. Rods, whose photopigments regenerate more slowly, do not reach their maximum sensitivity for about two hours. Cones take approximately 9–10 minutes to adapt to the dark.
Sensitivity to light is modulated by changes in intracellular calcium ions and cyclic guanosine monophosphate.The sensitivity of the rod pathway improves considerably within 5–10 minutes in the dark. Color testing has been used to determine the time at which rod mechanism takes over; when the rod mechanism takes over colored spots appear colorless as only cone pathways encode color.Three factors affect how quickly the rod mechanism becomes dominant:

Intensity and duration of the pre-adapting light: By increasing the levels of pre-adapting luminances, the duration of cone mechanism dominance extends, while the rod mechanism switch over is more delayed. In addition the absolute threshold takes longer to reach. The opposite is true for decreasing the levels of pre-adapting luminances.
Size and location on the retina: The location of the test spot affects the dark adaptation curve because of the distribution of the rods and cones in the retina.
Wavelength of the threshold light: Varying the wavelengths of stimuli also affect the dark adaptation curve. Long wavelengths—such as extreme red—create the absence of a distinct rod/cone break, as the rod and cone cells have similar sensitivities to light of long wavelengths. Conversely, at short wavelengths the rod/cone break is more prominent, because the rod cells are much more sensitive than cones once the rods have dark adapted."
Adaptation (eye),Intracellular signalling,"Under scotopic conditions, intracellular cGMP concentration is high in photoreceptors. cGMP binds to and opens cGMP gated Na+ channels to allow sodium and calcium influx. Sodium influx contributes to depolarization while calcium influx increases local calcium concentrations near the receptor. Calcium binds to a modulatory protein, which is proposed to be GUCA1B, removing this protein's stimulatory effect on guanylyl cyclase. This reduces cGMP production by guanylyl cyclase to lower cGMP concentration during prolonged darkness. Elevated calcium concentration also increases the activity of phosphodiesterase which hydrolyses cGMP to further reduce its concentration. This reduces opening of the cGMP gated Na+ channels to hyperpolarise the cell, once again making it sensitive to small increases in brightness. Without dark adaptation, the photoreceptor would remain depolarized under scotopic conditions and so also remain unresponsive to small changes in brightness."
Adaptation (eye),Inhibition,"Inhibition by neurons also affects activation in synapses. Together with the bleaching of a rod or cone pigment, merging of signals on ganglion cells are inhibited, reducing convergence.
Alpha adaptation, i.e., rapid sensitivity fluctuations, is powered by nerve control. The merging of signals by virtue of the diffuse ganglion cells, as well as horizontal and amacrine cells, allow a cumulative effect. Thus that area of stimulation is inversely proportional to intensity of light, a strong stimulus of 100 rods equivalent to a weak stimulus of 1,000 rods.
In sufficiently bright light, convergence is low, but during dark adaptation, convergence of rod signals boost. This is not due to structural changes, but by a possible shutdown of inhibition that stops convergence of messages in bright light. If only one eye is open, the closed eye must adapt separately upon reopening to match the already adapted eye."
Adaptation (eye),Measuring Dark Adaptation,"Ophthalmologists sometimes measure patients' dark adaptation using an instrument known as a dark adaptometer. Currently, there is one commercially available dark adaptometer, called the AdaptDx. It works by measuring a patient's Rod Intercept (RI) time. RI is the number of minutes it takes for the eye to adapt from bright light to darkness. This RI number provides a clear and objective measurement of retinal function with 90% sensitivity and specificity. An RI of less than 6.5 minutes indicates a healthy dark adaptation function. However, an RI higher than 6.5 indicates impaired dark adaptation."
Adaptation (eye),Using Dark Adaptation Measurement to Diagnose Disease,"Numerous clinical studies have shown that dark adaptation function is dramatically impaired from the earliest stages of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), and other retinal diseases, with increasing impairment as the diseases progress. AMD is a chronic, progressive disease that causes a part of the retina, called the macula, to slowly deteriorate over time. It is the leading cause of vision loss among people age 50 and older. It is characterized by a breakdown of the RPE/Bruch's membrane complex in the retina, leading to an accumulation of cholesterol deposits in the macula. Eventually, these deposits become clinically visible drusen that affect photoreceptor health, causing inflammation and a predisposition to choroidal neovascularization (CNV). During the AMD disease course, the RPE/Bruch's function continues to deteriorate, hampering nutrient and oxygen transport to the rod and cone photoreceptors. As a side effect of this process, the photoreceptors exhibit impaired dark adaptation because they require these nutrients for replenishment of photopigments and clearance of opsin to regain scotopic sensitivity after light exposure.
Measurement of a patient's dark adaptation function is essentially a bioassay of the health of their Bruch's membrane. As such, research has shown that, by measuring dark adaptation, doctors can detect subclinical AMD at least three years earlier than it is clinically evident."
Adaptation (eye),Accelerating dark adaptation,"Several different methods, with varying levels of evidence, have been purported or demonstrated to increase the rate at which vision can adapt in the dark."
Adaptation (eye),Red lights and lenses,"As a result of rod cells having a peak sensitivity at a wavelength of 530 nanometers they cannot perceive all colours on the visual spectrum. Because rod cells are insensitive to long wavelengths, the use of red lights and red lens glasses has become a common practice for accelerating dark adaptation. In order for dark adaptation to be significantly accelerated an individual should ideally begin this practice 30 minutes prior to entering a low luminescence setting. This practice will allow an individual to maintain their photopic (day) vision whilst preparing for scotopic vision. The insensitivity to red light will prevent the rod cells from further becoming bleached and allow for the rhodopsin photopigment to recharge back to its active conformation. Once an individual enters a dark setting most of their rod cells will already be accommodated to the dark and be able to transmit visual signals to the brain without an accommodation period.The concept of red lenses for dark adaptation is based upon experimentation by Antoine Béclère and his early work with radiology. In 1916, the scientist Wilhelm Trendelenburg invented the first pair of red adaptation goggles for radiologists to adapt their eyes to view screens during fluoroscopic procedures."
Adaptation (eye),Evolutionary context,"Although many aspects of the human visual system remain uncertain, the theory of the evolution of rod and cone photopigments is agreed upon by most scientists. It is believed that the earliest visual pigments were those of cone photoreceptors, with rod opsin proteins evolving later. Following the evolution of mammals from their reptilian ancestors approximately 275 million years ago there was a nocturnal phase in which complex colour vision was lost. Being that these pro-mammals were nocturnal they increased their sensitivity in low luminescence settings and reduced their photopic system from tetrachromatic to dichromatic. The shift to a nocturnal lifestyle would demand more rod photoreceptors to absorb the blue light emitted by the moon during the night. It can be extrapolated that the high ratio of rods to cones present in modern human eyes was retained even after the shift from nocturnal back to diurnal.
It is believed that the emergence of trichromacy in primates occurred approximately 55 million years ago when the surface temperature of the planet began to rise. The primates were diurnal rather than nocturnal in nature and therefore required a more precise photopic visual system. A third cone photopigment was necessary to cover the entire visual spectrum enabling primates to better discriminate between fruits and detect those of the highest nutritional value."
Adaptation (eye),Applications,"Aviators commonly wear red lensed glasses or goggles prior to taking off in the dark to ensure that they are able to see outside of the aircraft. Furthermore, throughout flight the cockpit is illuminated with dim red lights. This lighting is to ensure that the pilot is able to read instruments and maps while maintaining scotopic vision for looking outside.
Submarines: Oftentimes submarines are ""rigged for red,"" meaning that the boat is going to be surfacing or coming to periscope depth at night. During such times illumination within certain compartments is switched to red light to allow the eyes of the lookouts and officers to adjust to the darkness prior to looking outside of the boat. Additionally, compartments on a submarine may be illuminated with red light in order to simulate night conditions for the crew."
Adaptation (eye),Vitamin A,"Vitamin A is necessary for proper functioning of the human eye. The photopigment rhodopsin found in human rod cells is composed of retinal, a form of vitamin A, bound to an opsin protein. Upon the absorption of light rhodopsin was decomposed into retinal and opsin through bleaching. Retinal could then have one of two fates: it could recombine with opsin to reform rhodopsin or it could be converted into free retinol. The American scientist George Wald was the first to recognize that the visual system expends vitamin A and is dependent upon diet for its replacement.Vitamin A serves many functions in the human body outside of healthy vision. It is vital in maintaining a healthy immune system as well as promoting normal growth and development. The average adult male and female should consume 900 and 700 micrograms of vitamin A per day, respectively. Consumption above 3000 micrograms per day can lead to acute or chronic hypervitaminosis A."
Adaptation (eye),Sources of vitamin A,"Vitamin A is present in both animal and plant sources as retinoids and carotenoids, respectively. Retinoids can be used immediately by the body upon absorption into the cardiovascular system; however, plant-based carotenoids must be converted to retinol prior to utilization by the body. The highest animal-based sources of vitamin A are liver, dairy products, and fish. Fruits and vegetables containing high amounts of carotenoids are dark green, yellow, orange, and red in colour."
Adaptation (eye),Evolutionary context,Vitamin A-based opsin proteins have been used for sensing light in organisms for most of evolutionary history beginning approximately 3 billion years ago. This feature has been passed from unicellular to multicellular organisms including Homo sapiens. This vitamin was most likely selected by evolution for sensing light because retinal causes a shift in photoreceptor absorbance to the visible light range. This shift in absorbance is especially important for life on Earth because it generally matches the peak irradiance of sunlight on its surface. A second reason why retinal evolved to be vital for human vision is because it undergoes a large conformational change when exposed to light. This conformational change is believed to make it easier for the photoreceptor protein to distinguish between its silent and activated state thus better controlling visual phototransduction.
Adaptation (eye),Experimental evidence,"Various studies have been conducted testing the effective of vitamin A supplementation on dark adaptation. In a study by Cideciyan et al. the length of dark adaptation was measured in a patient with systemic vitamin A deficiency (VAD) before and after vitamin A supplementation. The dark adaptation function was measured prior to supplementation, 1 day post-treatment, and 75 days post-treatment. It was observed that after merely one day of vitamin A supplementation the recovery kinetics of dark adaptation were significantly accelerated after photoreceptor bleaching. Dark adaptation was further accelerated following 75 days of treatment.
A subsequent study by Kemp et al. studied dark adaptation in subjects with primary biliary cirrhosis and Crohn's disease, both of whom had vitamin A deficiency. Within 8 days of oral supplementation of vitamin A both patients had their visual function restored to normal. Furthermore, adaptation kinetics significantly improved in both subjects following supplementation."
Adaptation (eye),Anthocyanins,"Anthocyanins make up the majority of the 4000 known flavonoid phytochemicals. This group of approximately 600 bioactive antioxidants carries the strongest physiological effects of any plant compound. These chemicals are also the most visible of the flavonoid phytochemicals because they provide bright blue, red, or purple pigmentation to many plant species. Anthocyanins also serve to protect the photosynthetic tissues from the direct rays of the sun.
In addition, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and vasoprotective properties of anthocyanins allow them to demonstrate diverse health effects. In humans, anthocyanins are effective for a variety of health conditions including neurological damage, atherosclerosis, diabetes, as well as visual impairment. Anthocyanins frequently interact with other phytochemicals to potentiate biological effects; therefore, contributions from individual biomolecules remains difficult to decipher.
As a result of anthocyanins providing bright colouration to flowers, the plants containing these phytochemicals are naturally successful in attracting pollinators such as birds and bees. The fruits and vegetables produced by such plants are also brightly pigmented attracting animals to eat them and disperse the seeds. Due to this natural mechanism anthocyanin-containing plants are widely abundant in most areas of the world. The high abundance and distribution of anthocyanin-containing plants make it a natural food source for many animals. Through fossil evidence it is known that these compounds were eaten in high amounts by primitive hominins.During World Wars I and II British Air Force aviators were known to consume extensive amounts of bilberry jam. The aviators consumed this anthocyanin-rich food due to its many visual benefits, included accelerated dark adaptation, which would be valuable for night bombing missions."
Adaptation (eye),Food sources,"Brightly coloured fruits and vegetables are rich in anthocyanins. This makes sense intuitively because anthocyanins offer pigmentation to plants. Blackberries are the most anthocyanin-rich foods, containing 89-211 milligrams per 100 grams. Other foods that are rich in this phytochemical include red onions, blueberries, bilberries, red cabbage, and eggplant. The ingestion of any of these food sources will yield a variety of phytochemicals in addition to anthocyanins because they naturally exist together. The daily intake of anthocyanins is estimated to be approximately 200 milligrams in the average adult; however, this value can reach several grams per day if an individual is consuming flavonoid supplements."
Adaptation (eye),Effect on dark adaptation,"Anthocyanins accelerate dark adaptation in humans by enhancing the regeneration of the rod photopigment, rhodopsin. Anthocyanins accomplish this by binding directly to opsin upon the degradation of rhodopsin to its individual constituents by light. Once bound to opsin, the anthocyanin changes its structure thereby accelerating its access to the retinal binding pocket. By having a diet rich in anthocyanins an individual is able to generate rhodopsin in shorter periods of time because of the increased affinity of opsin to retinal. Through this mechanism an individual is able to accelerate dark adaptation and achieve night vision in a shorter period of time."
Adaptation (eye),Supportive evidence,"In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted by Nakaishi et al. a powdered anthocyanin concentrate derived from black currants was provided to a number of participants. Participants received one of three doses of anthocyanins to measure if the result occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The period of dark adaptation was measured prior to and two hours following supplementation in all participants. Results from this experiment indicate that anthocyanins significantly accelerated dark adaptation at merely one dose level compared to the placebo. Observing the data as a whole Nakaishi et al. concluded that anthocyanins effectively reduced the dark adaptation period in a dose-dependent manner."
Adaptation (eye),Contradictory evidence,"Despite the fact that many scientists believe anthocyanins to be beneficial in accelerating dark adaptation in humans, a study conducted by Kalt et al. in 2014 showed blueberry anthocyanins have no effect. In this study two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted to examine dark adaptation following the intake of blueberry products. In neither study did the blueberry anthocyanin intake effect the length of dark adaptation. From these results Kalt et al. concluded that blueberry anthocyanins provide no significant difference to the dark adaptation component of human vision."
Adaptation (eye),Light adaptation,"With light adaptation, the eye has to quickly adapt to the background illumination to be able to distinguish objects in this background. The process for light adaptation occurs over a period of five minutes.
The photochemical reaction is:

Rhodopsin ⇌ retinal + opsin"
Adaptation (eye),Increment threshold,"Using increment threshold experiments, light adaptation can be measured clinically. In an increment threshold experiment, a test stimulus is presented on a background of a certain luminance, the stimulus is increased until the detection threshold is reached against the background. A monophasic or biphasic threshold versus intensity TVI curve is obtained through this method for both cones and rods.
When the threshold curve for a single system (i.e., just cones or just rods) is taken in isolation it can be seen to possess four sections:
1. Dark light
The threshold in this portion of the TVI curve is determined by the dark/light level. Sensitivity is limited by neural noise. The background field is relatively low and does not significantly affect threshold.
2. Square root law
This part of the curve is limited by quantal fluctuation in the background. The visual system is usually compared with a theoretical construct called the ideal light detector. To detect the stimulus, the stimulus must sufficiently exceed the fluctuations of the background (noise).
3. Weber's law
Threshold increases with background luminance proportional to the square root of the background.
4. Saturation
At saturation, the rod system becomes unable to detect the stimulus. This section of the curve occurs for the cone mechanism under high background levels."
Adaptation (eye),Insufficiency,"Insufficiency of adaptation most commonly presents as insufficient adaptation to dark environment, called night blindness or nyctalopia. The opposite problem, known as hemeralopia, that is, inability to see clearly in bright light, is much rarer.
The fovea is blind to dim light (due to its cone-only array) and the rods are more sensitive, so a dim star on a moonless night must be viewed from the side, so it stimulates the rods. This is not due to pupil width since an artificial fixed-width pupil gives the same results.Night blindness can be caused by a number of factors the most common of which being vitamin A deficiency. If detected early enough nyctalopia can be reversed and visual function can be regained; however; prolonged vitamin A deficiency can lead to permanent visual loss if left untreated.Night blindness is especially prominent in developing countries due to malnutrition and therefore a lack of vitamin A in the diet. In developed countries night blindness has historically been uncommon due to adequate food availability; however, the incidence is expected to increase as obesity becomes more common. Increased obesity rates correspond to an increased number of bariatric surgeries, causing malabsorption of vitamin A in the human body."

Orthodox stance,Alternative stances,"The corresponding designation for a left-handed boxer is southpaw and is generally a mirror image of the orthodox stance. A southpaw boxer guards and jabs with their right hand. Some famous boxers who use southpaw are Marvelous Marvin Hagler,   Victor Ortiz, Sultan Ibragimov, Naseem Hamed, Joe Calzaghe, Manny Pacquiao, and Lucian Bute. Francisco Palacios, Andre Ward, and Terence Crawford normally fight as orthodox, but occasionally switch to a southpaw stance to confuse their opponents. Hagler was the opposite, normally fighting southpaw but able to switch to orthodox. Some fighters who are naturally left-handed fight in the orthodox stance with the advantage of a fast, hard jab and left hook, including Oscar De La Hoya, Sonny Liston, Miguel Angel Cotto, Gerry Cooney, and Marco Antonio Barrera. Likewise, Vasiliy Lomachenko is a naturally right-handed fighter who stands in the southpaw stance, as the same with Shakur Stevenson."

Alonso de Ojeda,Early life,"Alonso de Ojeda was born in Torrejoncillo del Rey, New Castile around 1466. His father, Rodrigo de Huete, was a minor noble who fought for Isabel in 1474 during the War of the Castilian Succession. Isabel was grateful for his support and put his son, Alonso, under her protection. In his youth, Alonso served the Duke of Medinaceli, Luis de la Cerda. In service to the duke, he distinguished himself in the conquest of Granada with his military abilities, his skill as a swordsman and his bravery.Alonso was slight of stature, clever, and handsome. It was reputed that he was always the first to draw blood in any fight. According to Bartolomé de las Casas, he combined ""in his person all the bodily perfections that man could have, despite his small size."""
Alonso de Ojeda,Arrival in Hispaniola,"Following Columbus' successful first voyage of discovery, a second voyage with a much larger fleet was organized for Columbus by Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca. Medinaceli had been a patron of both Columbus and Ojeda, so perhaps it is not surprising that Ojeda was selected at a relatively young age to captain one of the ships on this new voyage. Fonseca was also impressed with Ojeda and would later become his most important patron.The fleet sailed for the island of Hispaniola in September 1493 and reached the Caribbean in November. One of their first stops was the island of Guadalupe where a landing party went missing. Fearing for their safety (the islanders were suspected of being cannibals), Columbus sent Ojeda ashore with an armed contingent to search for the lost group. The missing party eventually showed up on their own but Ojeda's search turned up additional evidence that the Caribs on the island did practice cannibalism.They reached Hispaniola at the end of November and discovered the fort, Navidad, constructed during the first voyage was in ruins and all the Spaniards left behind were dead. The local natives blamed the trouble on a cacique from the interior named Caonabo. They began to explore the island and build a permanent settlement named Isabela. In January 1494, Columbus sent a small armed party led by Ojeda to search for gold in a mountainous region of the island known as Cibao. Ojeda returned two weeks later bringing a few substantial gold nuggets and reporting there was much gold to be found in the area.The discovery of gold focused attention on Cibao. In March 1494 Columbus led a group of nearly 500 men to explore the region. The hunt for gold was unsuccessful but natives from the surrounding area brought in gold for trade. Columbus established a fort, Santo Tomas (named as a rebuke to those who doubted the presence of gold), to serve as a trading post and as a base for further prospecting. Pedro Margarite, a nobleman from Aragon and a confidant of the king, was put in command of the fort when Columbus returned to Isabela.In April 1494, Columbus sent Ojeda with a force of about 350 soldiers to relieve Margarite at Santo Tomas. Columbus wanted Margarite to take the bulk of the soldiers and search the island for gold, seize food from the natives, and capture Caonabo. At an important river crossing controlled by a friendly tribe, Ojeda arrested the local cacique and other officials with the allegation that some clothes had been stolen during a previous expedition. Ojeda cut the ears off one captive and sent the rest back to Isabela in chains. Ojeda's brutal punishment shocked the local people and turned them against the Spaniards. When Ojeda arrived at the fort, Margarite refused to follow Columbus' orders and remained at the fort with his men. Not long after he returned to Spain, disapproving of the chaotic situation and mistreatment of the Indians.After Margarite's refusal to capture Caonabo, Columbus ordered Ojeda to find the cacique allegedly responsible for destroying the original Spanish settlement at Navidad. According to Bartolomé de las Casas, Ojeda presented Caonabo with a fine set of polished brass manacles and shackles and convinced him to wear them as a symbol of royalty. The ruse was successful and Ojeda brought the chief back to Columbus.Following Ojeda's mistreatment of the Indians at the river, a fort had to be built to protect the vital crossing. Late in 1494, the first Indian rebellion took place at this spot; the fort was destroyed and ten Spaniards killed by the local tribes. Columbus retaliated with a force of 500 led by Ojeda. The rebels were badly beaten and some 1500 were taken as slaves—600 were shipped to Spain and the remaining were parceled out to those on the island.Alonso de Ojeda also took part in the battle of Vega Real (also called the battle of Jáquimo), in which, under his command, the Spanish were victorious. An account of the battle written by Las Casas states that the native army comprised ten thousand warriors, while there were only some four hundred Spanish soldiers. Of course, these figures may have been exaggerated.  Ojeda returned to Spain in 1496."
Alonso de Ojeda,First voyage to Venezuela,"On returning to Spain, Ojeda was commissioned by the Catholic Monarchs, without the permission of Columbus, to sail for America again, which he did on 18 May 1499 with three caravels. He travelled with the pilot and cartographer Juan de la Cosa and the Italian navigator Amerigo Vespucci.  This was the first of a series of what have become known as the ""minor journeys"" or ""Andalusian journeys"" that were made to the New World.
On leaving Spain the flotilla sailed along the west coast of Africa to Cape Verde before taking the same route that Columbus had used a year before on his third voyage. After making landfall Vespucci decided to separate from the flotilla and he sailed south towards Brazil. The main flotilla arrived at the mouths of the rivers Essequibo and Orinoco in the Gulf of Paria. It also visited the peninsulas of Paria and Araya, the islands of Trinidad and Margarita and traveled along the continental coast, always in search of a passage towards India.  The flotilla then sailed along the Paraguaná Peninsula and sighted the island of Curacao, which was named Giants Island as the indigenous people that were seen were thought to be giants. During the same journey, he constructed a ship and visited the islands of Aruba and the Las Aves archipelago.
During the voyage along the Paraguaná Peninsula, the flotilla entered into a gulf (Gulf of Venezuela) where there were villages of the Wayuu people with palafito houses built over the water and supported on stilts made from tree trunks. These villages are said to have reminded Amerigo Vespucci of the city of Venice, (Italian: Venezia), and so the area was given the name Venezuela meaning  Little Venice. (However, according to Martín Fernández de Enciso, who supported Ojeda's 1509 expedition, they found a local population calling themselves the Veneciuela, so ""Venezuela"" may derive from the local term.) The flotilla arrived at the entrance to Lake Maracaibo on 24 August 1499. The lake was originally named after Saint Bartholomew as this was his saints day.  Ojeda also reached Cabo de la Vela, on the Guajira Peninsula, which he named Coquivacoa.
A few days later the expedition left Cabo de la Vela for Hispaniola with some pearls obtained in Paria, a little gold and several slaves. The scarcity of goods and slaves resulted in a poor economic return for investors in the expedition. However, the importance of the voyage comes from the fact that it was the first detailed reconnaissance of the coast of Venezuela and that Spanish explorers carried it out. Following Columbus' third voyage Ojeda is credited with leading the second European expedition to have visited Venezuela, and the first to have visited Colombia. The expedition also gave Juan de la Cosa the chance to draw the first known map of the area now known as Venezuela, as well as being possibly the first journey that Vespucci made to the New World.
However, when the expedition arrived in Hispaniola on 5 September the followers of Christopher Columbus were angry because they considered that Ojeda was infringing upon Columbus’ exploring privileges. This resulted in brawls and fights between both groups, which left many dead and wounded.   Ojeda took many captives back to Spain whom he sold as slaves.  Even so, the voyage was not financially successful, netting some fifteen thousand maravedis in profit to be divided among the fifty-five crew members surviving from the original three hundred. Note, that since forty maravedis per day was an average wage for skilled labor at this time, they could have made more money staying at home.  Returning on the heels of Pedro Alonso Nino's smaller but far more lucrative voyage magnified this disappointment.  The date of return is disputed: it is usually stated that Ojeda returned in June 1500 but the historian Demetrio Ramos has suggested the earlier date of November 1499."
Alonso de Ojeda,Second voyage to Venezuela,"Ojeda decided to make another journey and he received a new commission from the Catholic Monarchs on 8 June 1501. He was appointed Governor of Coquivacoa behind the back of Christopher Columbus. This appointment gave him the right to found a colony in this area, although he was advised not to visit Paria.  On this occasion he formed a partnership with the Andalusian merchants Juan de Vergara and García de Campos, who were able to charter four caravels: the Santa María de la Antigua, the Santa María de la Grenada, the Magdalena, and the Santa Ana.Ojeda set sail from Spain in January 1502 and he followed the same route as his first voyage. On this occasion, he kept his distance from the Gulf of Paria and made landfall on Margarita Island where, according to some sources, he tried to obtain gold and pearls from the indigenous people using several different methods. He sailed along the coast of Venezuela from Curiana to the Paraguaná Peninsula. On 3 May 1502, he founded a colony on the Guajira Peninsula, at Bahia Honda. The colony was called Santa Cruz and it was the first Spanish settlement on Colombian territory and therefore the first on the American mainland.However, the colony did not last for more than three months, as the new arrivals started attacking the indigenous villages in the area, causing constant conflict with them. In addition to this, there were personal difficulties between Ojeda and his men.  At this point, Vergara and Campos took Ojeda prisoner and abandoned the settlement with the small amount of plunder that had been captured. Ojeda was put in prison in Hispaniola in May 1502, where he was held until 1504. He was released following an appeal made by Archbishop Rodríguez de Fonseca, although he had to pay a costly indemnity, which left him with little money.
The second voyage was, therefore, a failure as he had not discovered any new areas and he had not received much of a share of the plunder obtained by Vergara and Campos. Besides, the Santa Cruz colony was abandoned and the Governorship of Coquivacoa was abolished."
Alonso de Ojeda,Third voyage to New Andalusia,"On regaining his freedom Ojeda remained in Hispaniola for four years with little to do. (Some authors think that, on his release from prison, Ojeda returned to Spain.) Then in 1508 he learned that King Ferdinand the Catholic was interviewing people interested in colonizing and governing the section of mainland between the capes of Cabo Gracias a Dios (on the border between present-day Honduras and Nicaragua) and Cabo de la Vela in present-day Colombia.  Juan de la Cosa went to Spain to represent Ojeda at court. One of Ojeda's rivals was Diego de Nicuesa.
Both candidates had good reputations and sympathizers at court, so the King decided to divide the region into two governorates: Veragua to the west and New Andalusia to the east as far as the Gulf of Urabá. The former was awarded to Nicuesa and the latter to Ojeda in a commission signed in 1508.: 95, 134–135 The new governors repaired to Santo Domingo to prepare the expeditionary flotillas. There was a great disparity between the two flotillas. As Nicuesa was wealthier and had better credit with the colonial authorities he was able to attract 800 men, many horses, five caravels and two brigs. While Ojeda's flotilla only consisted of a little more than 300 men, two brigs and two smaller ships. Among those who embarked on these four vessels was Francisco Pizarro, the future conqueror of Peru. Hernán Cortés, who was later to dominate Mexico, would have been among the soldiers of fortune engaged in this adventure, had a sudden illness not prevented him from sailing.  Due to the disputes regarding the extent of each of the two governorates, Juan de la Cosa decided that the River Atrato would form the boundary between the two regions.
Ojeda promised to make the wealthy lawyer Martín Fernández de Enciso mayor of the new colony that Ojeda planned to establish in New Andalusia. Encisco was ordered to follow on after the main flotilla with a chartered boat and more provisions. The main flotilla finally set sail from Santo Domingo on 10 November 1509, a few days ahead of Nicuesa.
The flotilla arrived at Bahia de Calamar in present-day Cartagena (Colombia). This was against the wishes of De la Cosa who did not want to land in the area.  After disembarking with about 70 men Ojeda encountered some indigenous tribes. He then sent out missionaries and interpreters to read out the proclamation that had been drafted by Palacios Rubios. The indigenous people were upset by this proclamation and so Ojeda tried to placate them by offering them trinkets. At this time the Spanish were also raiding villages to capture Indians for slaves. An eyewitness account recorded by historian Bartolomé de las Casas notes, ""The Spaniards worked an incredible slaughter on that village, they spared no one, women, children, babies or not.  Then they robbed.""  These actions so provoked the indigenous people that they started to fight against the Spanish settlers. Ojeda defeated the natives in the coastal area and on pursuing some of the survivors who had escaped into the jungle he came upon the village of Turbaco. The Spanish were then taken by surprise by a counterattack.  Nearly the entire party were wiped out in the battle and Juan de la Cosa sacrificed his life so that Ojeda could escape.  Only one other Spanish soldier survived the battle and he and Ojeda fled back to the coast where they were rescued by the ships anchored in the bay.
Nicuesa arrived with his flotilla soon after and, worried by Ojeda's losses, he gave him arms and men. The two men then forgot their differences and joined forces to seek revenge on the people of Turbaco, who were massacred to a man."
Alonso de Ojeda,Governor of Nueva Andalucía and Urabá,"Nicuesa then left for Veragua while Ojeda continued traveling along the coast of Nueva Andalucía toward the southwest.  On 20 January 1510 he founded the settlement of San Sebastián de Urabá, which in reality was little more than a fort.However, the fort soon grew short of food, which exacerbated the problems caused by the unhealthy climate and the constant threat of attack by the local tribes who attacked the Spaniards with poisoned arrows. Ojeda was wounded in the leg by one such attack.
Eight months after the flotilla left Santo Domingo the assistance promised by Fernández de Enciso still had not arrived.  Francisco Pizarro was placed in charge of the fort and ordered to stay there for the fifty days that it would take for Ojeda to travel to and return from Santo Domingo.  However, Ojeda never returned to San Sebastian and after the fifty days, Pizarro decided to leave the colony in the two brigs along with the 70 colonists. A little later Fernández de Enciso, along with Vasco Núñez de Balboa, arrived to assist the survivors. The indigenous people who lived in the area later burnt down the fort.
Ojeda eventually returned to Santo Domingo in the brig of a Spanish pirate called Bernardino de Talavera who was fleeing from Hispaniola and passed by the port."
Alonso de Ojeda,Shipwrecked in Cuba,"When Ojeda returned to Santo Domingo he was accompanied by seventy men and he was seeking help.  However, the pirate took Ojeda prisoner and would not set him free. At this point, a powerful hurricane struck the boat and Talavera had to seek help from Ojeda. Despite their efforts, the ship was shipwrecked at Jagua, Sancti Spíritus, in the south of Cuba. Ojeda decided to travel along the coast on foot with Talavera and his men to reach Maisí Point from where they would be able to get to Hispaniola.
However, the party faced several difficulties en route and half of the men died of hunger, illness or other hardships that they met along the way.  The sole possession remaining to Ojeda was an image of the Virgin Mary, which he had carried with him since he left Spain. He made a promise on this image that he would build a church dedicated to her in the first village that he reached where he was given hospitality.
A little later, and with only a dozen men and the pirate Talavera still surviving, he arrived in the district of Cueybá where the chief Cacicaná provided food and shelter.  Ojeda was true to his word and he built a small hermitage to the Virgin in the village, which was venerated by the local people.  The party was rescued by Pánfilo de Narváez and taken to Jamaica, where Talavera was imprisoned for piracy.  From Jamaica Ojeda returned to Hispaniola where he learned that Fernández de Enciso had been able to relieve the colonists who had stayed in San Sebastián."
Alonso de Ojeda,Later life and death,"After the failure of his journey to Nueva Andalucía, Ojeda did not mount any further expeditions and he renounced his position as governor.  He lived out the last five years of his life in Santo Domingo. He later withdrew to the Monasterio de San Francisco where he died in 1515. Las Casas records of his death, that ""He died sick and poor, he didn't have a cent to bury him, I think, for all the pearls, the gold he had … stolen from the Indians, for all the slaves he had made of them the times he hit the mainland.  He willed himself to be buried (beneath) the door of the … monastery of St. Francis..."" This was so that all the visitors to the monastery would walk over his grave as a penance for all the errors that he had committed during his life.
His remains were moved to the former Convento Dominico. The excavations also found the remains of Bartholomew Columbus."
Alonso de Ojeda,Legacy,"Ciudad Ojeda, a city on the eastern shore of Lake Maracaibo, is named in his honor.
The Spanish writer Vicente Blasco Ibáñez tells the story of the life of the conquistador in his novel El Caballero de la Virgen (1929).
Also the Spanish writer Alberto Vázquez-Figueroa tells the story of Ojeda's life in his novel Centauros (2007)."

Anna Rezan,Early life,"She was born in Athens to Fotis Rezan Kritseli and Eva Matilda Kalamara, both of whom are interested in dramatic arts. Her father, who is of Izmirian, Cretan and Peloponnesian descent, is a federal judge who had aspirations to be a director; her mother, a Greek-Jewish attorney of Spanish and Polish descent, studied at Karolos Koun's School of Dramatic Arts before going to law school. Her maternal great-grandmother did not survived Auschwitz during World War II. Rezan has an older brother, Leon, is maternally related to Maria Rezan and paternally related to Constantine P Cavafy.Her father died in August 2007.Rezan was interested in the arts from an early age and decided to be an actress after watching Greek movies, musicals, Disney films, and comedies. She started performing at age 11 in a school play and later performed with Stagecoach Productions. She began writing lyrics at age 9  and started electric guitar lessons at 17. At age 11, she starred in a theatrical show performing Oops!... I Did It Again while on summer holiday with her family. The following year, she starred in The Hall of Fame of the Moon, which premiered at the Greek National Opera and was produced by Cyprus' Ministry of Culture. Greece's Minister of Education attended the performance. She took classes at New York Film Academy and enrolled at Panteion University to study journalism in late 2009. She also took acting courses at Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute in Los Angeles, where she lived part-time. As a teenager, her articles, which centered on love, therapy, films, and musicians such as David Bowie, Nick Cave, and The Cure, were published in indie magazines."

Marybeth Yuen Maul,Personal life,"Maul was born in Honolulu on March 26, 1925, to Yun Kee Yuen and Lin Tai (Chock) Yuen. She had three siblings: Lilyan, Jane, and  John (""Sonny""). Her father, Yun Kee Yuen worked for the Libby pineapple company as an office clerk and bookkeeper. Maul's family often spent summers in Moloka'i.  Maul's parents sent her and her siblings to stay with David Beckwith, the cousin of a family friend, in Wisconsin during World War II in order to protect them. Marybeth would later return to Moloka'i to practice law and to help her father in the 1950s. Maul and her family started the first Chinese restaurant on Moloka'i called Hop Inn in 1963. She also cofounded the Molokai Humane Society, volunteered with the Girl Scouts, and served on the State Advisory Committee to the Department of Education on Title IV.Maul raised her two daughters, Robin Campbell and Christy Rice, on Moloka'i. As of 2010, she had four grandchildren."
Marybeth Yuen Maul,Education,"Maul first attended Punahou School as one of the few Asian students present. However, due to World War II and the Bombing of Pearl Harbor, Punahou's school campus was commandeered by the U.S. military and the students were transferred to the University of Hawaii High School. Maul's parents decided to send Marybeth, her brother, and one of her sisters to Wisconsin with a family friend's cousin in an attempt to keep them safe during the war.In 1943, Marybeth graduated from the University of Wisconsin High School. She went on to attend the University of Wisconsin where she graduated in 1947 with a degree in political science. Maul attended Cornell Law School but later transferred and finished her law degree at the University of Wisconsin in 1950.Maul took the Hawai'i bar examination twice. She failed by .02 points in 1950 but passed in 1952."
Marybeth Yuen Maul,Career,"Maul was a law clerk for two years in Chicago from 1950 to 1952. In 1952, Maul started working in the Honolulu city attorney's office. She was one of the only practicing attorneys on the island for several years. Maul's clients were often plantation workers for the pineapple companies and she usually assisted them pro bono or at a lowered rate.In 1957, Judge Stanley Ashford recommended Maul to serve as magistrate for the island of Moloka'i. She would serve as magistrate from 1957 to 1971.From 1985 to 1992, Maul worked at the Department of Health settlement for former Hansen's disease patients at Kalaupapa as an administrator.Maul retired in 1992."
Marybeth Yuen Maul,Awards,"Maul was awarded the Keeper of the Flame Award in 1988 by the Hawaii Immigrant Justice Center for leadership and commitment to people of Hawaii.

Almost periodic function,Motivation,"There are several inequivalent definitions of almost periodic functions. The first was given by Harald Bohr. His interest was initially in finite Dirichlet series. In fact by truncating the series for the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) to make it finite, one gets finite sums of terms of the type

  
    
      
        
          e
          
            (
            σ
            +
            i
            t
            )
            log
            ⁡
            n
          
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle e^{(\sigma +it)\log n}\,}
  with s written as (σ + it) – the sum of its real part σ and imaginary part it.  Fixing σ, so restricting attention to a single vertical line in the complex plane, we can see this also as

  
    
      
        
          n
          
            σ
          
        
        
          e
          
            (
            log
            ⁡
            n
            )

            t
          
        
        .
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle n^{\sigma }e^{(\log n)it}.\,}
  Taking a finite sum of such terms avoids difficulties of analytic continuation to the region σ < 1. Here the 'frequencies' log n will not all be commensurable (they are as linearly independent over the rational numbers as the integers n are multiplicatively independent – which comes down to their prime factorizations).
With this initial motivation to consider types of trigonometric polynomial with independent frequencies, mathematical analysis was applied to discuss the closure of this set of basic functions, in various norms.
The theory was developed using other norms by Besicovitch, Stepanov, Weyl, von Neumann, Turing, Bochner and others in the 1920s and 1930s."
Almost periodic function,Uniform or Bohr or Bochner  almost periodic functions,"Bohr (1925) defined the uniformly almost-periodic functions as the closure of the trigonometric polynomials with respect to the uniform norm

    {\displaystyle \|f\|_{\infty }=\sup _{x}|f(x)|}
  (on bounded functions f on R).  In other words, a function f is uniformly almost periodic if for every ε > 0 there is a finite linear combination of sine and cosine waves that is of distance less than ε from f with respect to the uniform norm.  Bohr proved that this definition was equivalent to the existence of a relatively dense set of ε almost-periods, for all ε > 0: that is, translations T(ε) = T of the variable t  making

    {\displaystyle \left|f(t+T)-f(t)\right|<\varepsilon .}
  An alternative definition due to Bochner (1926) is equivalent to that of Bohr and is relatively simple to state:

A function f is almost periodic if every sequence {ƒ(t + Tn)} of translations of f has a subsequence that converges uniformly for t in (−∞, +∞).
The Bohr almost periodic functions are essentially the same as continuous functions on the Bohr compactification of the reals."

The Besicovitch almost periodic functions in B2 have an expansion (not necessarily convergent) as

  
    
      
        ∑
        
          a
          
            n

    {\displaystyle \sum a_{n}e^{i\lambda _{n}t}}
  with Σa2n finite and λn real. Conversely every such series is the expansion of some Besicovitch periodic function (which is not unique).
The space Bp of Besicovitch almost periodic functions (for p ≥ 1) contains the space Wp of Weyl almost periodic functions. If one quotients out a subspace of ""null"" functions, it can be identified with the space of Lp functions on the Bohr compactification of the reals."
Almost periodic function,Almost periodic functions on a locally compact abelian group,"With these theoretical developments and the advent of abstract methods (the Peter–Weyl theorem, Pontryagin duality and Banach algebras) a general theory became possible. The general idea of almost-periodicity in relation to a locally compact abelian group G becomes that of a function F in L∞(G), such that its translates by G form a relatively compact set.
Equivalently, the space of almost periodic functions is the norm closure of the finite linear combinations of characters of G. If G is compact the almost periodic functions are the same as the continuous functions.
The Bohr compactification of G is the  compact abelian group  of all possibly discontinuous characters of the dual group of G, and is a compact group containing G as a dense subgroup. The space of uniform almost periodic functions on G can be identified with the space of all continuous functions on the Bohr compactification of G. More generally the Bohr compactification can be defined for any topological group G, and the spaces of continuous or Lp functions on the Bohr compactification can be considered as almost periodic functions on G.
For locally compact connected groups G the map from G to its Bohr compactification is injective if and only if G is a central extension of a compact group,  or equivalently the product of a compact group and a finite-dimensional vector space."
Almost periodic function,Quasiperiodic signals in audio and music synthesis,"In speech processing, audio signal processing, and music synthesis, a quasiperiodic signal, sometimes called a quasiharmonic signal, is a waveform that is virtually periodic microscopically, but not necessarily periodic macroscopically. This does not give a quasiperiodic function in the sense of the Wikipedia article of that name, but something more akin to an almost periodic function, being a nearly periodic function where any one period is virtually identical to its adjacent periods but not necessarily similar to periods much farther away in time.  This is the case for musical tones (after the initial attack transient) where all partials or overtones are harmonic (that is all overtones are at frequencies that are an integer multiple of a fundamental frequency of the tone).

        P

The Blackest Beautiful,Background,"Jason Aalon Butler, the band's front-man and remaining founding member, described the group's first releases, extended play Exhaustion, Saltwater, And Everything In Between (2004) and debut album Speak Like You Talk (2005), as ""educational experiences"" in writing whole songs rather than ""cool bits"" for songs. Music journalist Andrew Kelham wrote that the era these ""raw hardcore punk"" records were produced in was plagued by ""potential [that] was never realised as an ever-revolving door of musicians cause the band to limp through Jason's late teens and early twenties.""  With the second album, Fake History, the band felt they found their ""signature sound"".  In 2008, when performing as a substitute opening support band for Bring Me the Horizon's show in Los Angeles, they caught the attention of Brett Gurewitz, owner of Epitaph Records, who later signed the band and re-released their second album in 2011."
The Blackest Beautiful,Recording and production,"In 2010, Letlive began writing on the third album. Butler said that their writing approach changed in comparison to their previous releases, as they were now doing most of it while on tour. During pre-production, the band listened to styles and ideas that, according to Butler, changed the way they looked at the songs they had initially written. The styles were their most expansive to date, and came from the diversity of their members: Butler had involved himself in the punk rock skateboarding culture when he was eleven, but had also been influenced by his father, who was in a soul band.When they began recording in studio in June 2012, the band's members felt little pressure to complete the album as they could deliver something similar to their previous album ""if you've delivered once already, why would it be a problem to do it again? We are the band that made those records [...] so there's really no problem in that regard."" Guitarist Jeff Sahyoun said he did not even think back on Fake History when they were producing The Blackest Beautiful. However, as they progressed through it, there were elements that were not clicking, and the performances lacked the same bite in comparison to their Fake History demos.  Butler said that this ""almost sent the band crazy"". He said he required a specific environment when he sings as his performance puts him in a vulnerable state.During a tour where they supported Underoath in October, they brought their studio equipment with them, which allowed them to record on the road. Butler said ""It was like we'd have a pop up studio in a bathroom in South Florida or in the woods off the highway in Wyoming."" In December, the band felt they were done with recordings; Butler said ""there was absolutely nothing left to try"", and walked away from the project. The band had recorded the drums on four occasions. They finished recording at a static studio in January 2013.Although there was increasing demand from fans, the band took their time with mixing and producing. Butler said the pressure was more rooted in giving the fans an album they deserve rather than meeting the expectations of the band. He said it was ""one of the hardest processes I've endured as a human being, not just as an artist, but ever."" Because Fake History was perceived by fans as sounding overproduced, the band strove for an ""organic and authentic"" sound that was ""very human"" and that reflected the sound of their live performances. They took ""an analogue route"", where they used the test mix of the album as it ""spoke to them"" in its raw energy. After going through ten sound engineers, they went with Stephen George, whom Sahyoun said ""just added little diamonds and made it pop"", so the album sonically reminded them of their influences.During the recording sessions, drummer Anthony Rivera left the band. Butler said the departure was an ""amicable split"": ""sometimes you simply need more than what the artist lifestyle gives you, and that's fine"". Chris Crandall replaced Rivera for the studio sessions, and Loniel Robinson, a drum tech from the band Of Mice and Men replaced Crandall following the album release."
The Blackest Beautiful,Artwork and packaging,"When the band was creating the album art, they intended to create something provocative and captivating and so they experimented with how ""black and white American flags could represent ""a much bigger idea of the sterilization that we are experiencing."" The title is a play on the saying ""Black is beautiful"" and how it acts as an opposition to everything that society is saying otherwise."
The Blackest Beautiful,Composition,
The Blackest Beautiful,Music,"The Blackest Beautiful was described as a post-hardcore record, much like its predecessors, from ""screaming rage to tight, sophisticated harmonies to frenzied funky riffing to emotively melodic parts"". Mike Diver of Clash considered it a pop record with clear, melodic structure, while others grouped it with punk rock, soul, and funk, as well as displaying 'glimpses' of other music styles including Afrobeat, electronica and jazz. The incorporation of funk music has been noted by critics. Stephen Hill described the album as ""find[ing] the space between DC Hardcore and Stax funk"". James McMahon described the album as being ""dragged through the civil rights movement, through 80s New York block parties, through the birth of hip-hop, funk, jazz and soul."" Terry Bezer in Front found that the album has 'as much in common with funk as punk' and wrote in Metal Hammer that the album features 'the musical dexterity and reckless abandon of razor-edged funk'. Letlive's ferocity and use of dynamics have led critics to draw comparisons to rock bands Glassjaw, At the Drive-in, Refused, Black Flag and Deftones. Bezer cited three albums as primary influences on The Blackest Beautiful: Raised Fist's Veil of Ignorance and its ""tempo changes, fury and non-stop fire""; Prince's Love Symbol Album and funk style; and Public Enemy's It Takes A Nation Of Millions for its confrontational and ""fight for what's right"" lyrics. Butler said that there was a poetic play in their combination of melody and chaos on the album: ""I think the best way for us as musicians to get people to listen is to appeal to them. Appeal to the natural rhythm of the head bob, the beating of the heart, the tap of the foot; just find that area and utilize it properly and say something.""The album's lead single, ""Banshee (Ghost Fame)"", was described as an ""unholy collision of Refused and Rage Against the Machine"". ""White America's Beautiful Black Market"" was a ""rock rap crossover affair"", a protest song about the relationship between the corporations and the United States government, as they are ""sucking the dicks of corporations"". ""Empty Elvis"" was described as  ""condensing Glassjaw's whole career into three mouth-foamingly [sic] exciting minutes"". ""That Fear Fever"" fused rock, pop and metal. ""Virgin Dirt"" was described as a ""post-rock epic"". The tracks ""Younger"" and ""The Dope Beat"" were listed as examples of the band's ""staggering dynamics, brain-burrowing melodies and intelligent production tricks"". ""Pheromone Cvlt"" showed the band's ""blend of deranged hardcore and aching soul""; Bezer wrote that the track possesses 'Prince levels of funked up cool'. ""27 Club"" was a ""blistering seven-minute epic"" about living life either selflessly or selfishly, with ""rampages from Hendrix riffs to reggae""."
The Blackest Beautiful,Lyrics,"The album's lyrics are described as 'politically, socially and personally conscious', incorporating themes such as corporate greed, racism and growing up in a broken home. Butler says it is ""an ode to the disenfranchised and disaffected youth"" and about accepting that we will never be perfect. Some of the lyrics reflect on his early life where he had to raise his sister and grow up at the same time. He added ambiguity to the lyrics to ""facilitate"" ideas for the listeners. Freeman said that the lyrics ""reveal just how self-aware he is, which is a good counterpoint to those who feel that his constant vocalizing equates to selfishness.""""Banshee (Ghost Fame)"" describes the differences between music as an art form and as an industry. ""The Priest and Used Cars"" talks about clockwork theory and how it put the fear of death into Butler when he was younger. ""Pheromone Cvlt"" is about a one-night stand Butler had, telling the woman the following morning that he loved her but later realizing that was a lie, the song acting as his ""apology"" to the woman. In an intro before playing the song at the Electric Ballroom, Butler described the song; ""Imagine yourself in bed, lying next to someone that believes that you're in love with them. And then imagine walking up in the middle of the night while they're asleep and feeling compelled to write a song about how you don't know what the fuck it means to be in love. Imagine turning around in your bedroom, and looking at your bed that lies in the corner of your room and that person is still sleeping, and you want to wake that person up and you wanna tell that person your sorry for saying all the things that you said to make them believe that you were in love with them. That's kinda where I'm at right now it's um… It's a very difficult thing for me to tell this person that, ""I'm sorry. I don't–I never loved you to begin with and I'm sorry that I told you that I did."" Instead of telling that person exactly how I feel, I wrote a song instead, and I'm playing in front of about 1,200 people at the Electric Ballroom. So maybe, maybe she'll just hear about the song and understand that I'm sorry. I don't know."""". Butler commented how the lyrics of ""27 Club"" focus on ""when people assume I'm pumped full of drugs or a Christian. I'm misidentified all the time""."
The Blackest Beautiful,Release and promotion,"The album was initially announced in Rock Sound for a summer 2013 release; later specified to be July 9, 2013. A few weeks prior to its release, the album was streamed online for free. Although Butler acknowledged that the strategy would mean the album would not sell well, he said ""It's not about how many people it reaches but that it makes them feel something.""The band toured the United Kingdom and Ireland in October, playing songs from both Fake History and The Blackest Beautiful. Many of the dates were sold out; London's date was met with such high demand that it was upgraded to a larger venue from the Camden Underworld to the Electric Ballroom. At Clwb Ifor Bach, Quench magazine writer Jack Glasscock said that they are ""without doubt, the most exhilarating live band around"" with their primal and engaging front-man Butler, Kerrang! writer David McLaughlin gave the show a five out of five ""K's"". He said, ""No longer just a spectacle, to be gasped at in almost voyeuristic fascination wondering what might happen next, letlive. are now about songs, feeling, performance"".In November and December, the band returned to the United States where they supported Every Time I Die with Code Orange Kids.In February and March 2014, the band supported Bring Me the Horizon for their Sempiternal album, joining groups Of Mice & Men and Issues on The American Dream Tour. From April to May, they co-headlined a tour with Architects for their album Lost Forever // Lost Together, with support from Glass Cloud and I The Mighty. On August 26, they and Architects supported A Day To Remember at a postponed event at the Cardiff Motorpoint Arena."
The Blackest Beautiful,Reception,
The Blackest Beautiful,Critical reception,"The album received an aggregate score of 86/100 at Metacritic, based on 12 reviews, signifying ""universal acclaim"". Kerrang! editor James Mcmahon gave the album five out of five ""K""s, classing The Blackest Beautiful as a ""classic"", praising the inclusion of producers Kit Walters and Stephen George. He wrote: ""What The Blackest Beautiful certainly is, though, is the sound of letlive. right here and right now. And right now, letlive. sound amazing. Get Down."" Metal Hammer writer Stephen Hill gave the album a nine out of ten, saying ""it's hard to pick out highlights when every track sounds so fresh, joyous and casually rule-book torching"" and that ""this is the kind of album that changes people's lives"". Chris Hidden of Rock Sound also gave a nine out of ten, calling it a ""bold record"" and highlighting its fusion of ""staggering dynamics, brain-burrowing melodies and intelligent production"".Fred Thomas of AllMusic noted how the album is ""technically dazzling and soulfully delivered aggression"". Tom Doyle of This Is Fake DIY wrote that the album is a ""punch in the gut to whatever expectations you might have about letlive."" Channing Freeman of Sputnikmusic said while the songs lack the same immediacy in comparison to those on Fake History, they have more longevity. Although Mike Diver of Clash Music liked the album overall, he said that ""Pheromone Cvlt"" was ""placid"" and ""Virgin Dirt"" was ""losing sting"".However, Dave Simpson, writing for The Guardian, criticized the album's ""adolescent, cliched lyrics"", especially from the track ""The Priest and Used Cars""."

Oryzomys dimidiatus,Taxonomy,"The first known specimen was obtained by W.G. Palmer in 1904 and the next year, Oldfield Thomas of the British Museum of Natural History described this animal as the holotype of a new species he named Nectomys dimidiatus. He placed it in the genus Nectomys, commenting that it was much smaller than, but otherwise similar to previously known members of that genus. The species was listed as a Nectomys in taxonomic overviews in the next decades, including a 1944 review of the genus by Philip Hershkovitz.After examining the holotype in London, Hershkovitz instead placed the species in the genus Oryzomys in 1948. He remarked that it was an especially distinctive member of that genus, and hence classified it in its own subgenus Micronectomys. J. Hernández-Camacho described a second species of Micronectomys, Oryzomys (Micronectomys) borreroi, from Colombia in 1957. In 1970, Hershkovitz treated O. dimidiatus in another publication and conceded that his name Micronectomys was a nomen nudum (""naked name"") because he had not explicitly mentioned characters differentiating it from other taxa in his 1948 publication. Nevertheless, he did not do anything to rectify the situation, and Micronectomys remains a nomen nudum. Hershkovitz also noted that while O. dimidiatus resembles a juvenile Nectomys in external anatomy, it is otherwise similar to the marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris). He accepted O. borreroi as an Oryzomys, but did not think it closely related to O. dimidiatus. Six years later, Alfred Gardner and James Patton instead suggested O. borreroi was a Zygodontomys, and in his 1991 review of that genus Robert Voss confirmed that it is the same as Zygodontomys brunneus.A second specimen was obtained in 1966 and the find was published in 1971 by Hugh Genoways and Knox Jones, who noted that the species is closely similar to O. palustris. Later workers affirmed the relationship between O. dimidiatus, O. palustris and associated species like O. couesi. Fiona Reid reported in 1997 that a third specimen had been found. In 2006, Marcelo Weksler and coworkers removed most of the species formerly placed in Oryzomys from the genus, because they are not closely related to the type species O. palustris, but kept O. dimidiatus as an Oryzomys.Oryzomys dimidiatus is now recognized as one of eight species in the genus Oryzomys. O. dimidiatus is further part of the O. couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O. couesi and also includes six other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. O. couesi occurs with O. dimidiatus in southeastern Nicaragua. Many aspects of the systematics of the O. couesi section remain unclear and it is likely that the current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group. Oryzomys is classified in the tribe Oryzomyini (""rice rats""), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.Oryzomys dimidiatus or ""divided in the middle rice rat"" derives respectively from the Greek oryza ""rice"", mys ""mouse, rat"", and the Latin dimidiatus ""divided in the middle"", from dimidio ""halve, divide in two equal parts""."
Oryzomys dimidiatus,Description,"Oryzomys dimidiatus is a medium-sized rice rat, smaller than O. couesi, with thick, lustrous fur and velvety underfur. The hairs on the back are about 6 mm in length. The upperparts are gray-brown with some dark hairs, appearing darker overall than in O. couesi; the color becomes more yellowish towards the sides. According to Thomas, a faint buff line extends from the sides to the inner sides of the hindlegs. The underparts are grayish, contrasting with the buffy underparts of O. couesi. The snout is short and the well-haired ears are partly hidden by the fur. The hands and feet are off-white or brownish above, not white as in O. couesi. The hindfeet show small interdigital webs, but they lack long tufts of hair on the digits and some of the pads are reduced or absent. The tail is about as long as the head and body and contains about 15 rings per centimeter. It is slightly darker (grayish) above than below (whitish), but the difference in color is much less pronounced than in O. couesi.Compared to that of Nectomys, the skull is lightly built and has narrow nasals and a broad, round braincase without conspicuous ridges on it. The zygomatic plate is broad. The incisive foramina (perforations of the front part of the palate) extend between the first molars and are broadest in their back halves. The broad mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the end of the palate, is perforated by sphenopalatine vacuities. The molar crowns are not as simplified as in Nectomys species, but the front cusps of the upper (anterocone) and lower first molar (anteroconid) are not divided in two. In addition to the main roots, the upper and lower first molars have smaller additional roots.Measurements for the first two known examples are as follows (in each case, the first measurement given is from the holotype, taken in 1904, the second, from the specimen taken in 1966): head and body length 125 and 118 mm (4.9 and 4.6 in), tail length 115 and 110 mm (4.5 and 4.3 in), hindfoot length 27 and 28 mm (1.1 and 1.1 in), ear length 13 and 15 mm (0.51 and 0.59 in), skull length 29.8 and 29.0 mm (1.17 and 1.14 in). The 1966 specimen weighed 46.0 g (1.62 oz) and had testes 11 mm (0.43 in) long; these measurements were not recorded in the 1904 specimen. Reid, who mentioned the third specimen, reported a maximum head and body length of 128 mm (5.0 in), tail length of 150 mm (5.9 in), hindfoot length of 31 mm (1.2 in), and ear length of 19 mm (0.75 in)."
Oryzomys dimidiatus,"Distribution, ecology, and behavior","Oryzomys dimidiatus is known from three specimens collected in the lowlands of the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region in southeastern Nicaragua. The first, an old male, was collected on November 5, 1904, in a banana plantation with very moist red clay on the Río Escondido near El Rama. The second, a young adult male, was caught on July 26, 1966, in dense cane on the south bank of the Río Mico at El Recreo, 15 km (9 mi) west from the location of the first specimen, along with three other rice rats (O. couesi, Melanomys caliginosus, and Oligoryzomys fulvescens), the cotton rat Sigmodon hirsutus, and the cottontail rabbit Sylvilagus brasiliensis. The third was caught at a stream near Bluefields. Reid suggested that the species is semiaquatic, spending some time in the water, like other Oryzomys.The 2019 IUCN Red List assessed the conservation status of Oryzomys dimidiatus as ""Data Deficient"", noting that very little is currently known about the species."

Windows Driver Model,Overview,"WDM drivers are layered in a stack and communicate with each other via I/O request packets (IRPs). The Microsoft Windows Driver Model unified driver models for the Windows 9x and Windows NT product lines by standardizing requirements and reducing the amount of code that needed to be written. WDM drivers will not run on operating systems earlier than Windows 98 or Windows 2000, such as Windows 95 (before the OSR2 update that sideloads the WDM model), Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 3.1. By conforming to WDM, drivers can be binary compatible and source-compatible across Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, Windows Me, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Vista (for backwards compatibility) on x86-based computers. WDM drivers are designed to be forward-compatible so that a WDM driver can run on a version of Windows newer than what the driver was initially written for, but doing that would mean that the driver cannot take advantage of any new features introduced with the new version. WDM is generally not backward-compatible, that is, a WDM driver is not guaranteed to run on any older version of Windows.  For example, Windows XP can use a driver written for Windows 2000 but will not make use of any of the new WDM features that were introduced in Windows XP. However, a driver written for Windows XP may or may not load on Windows 2000.
WDM exists in the intermediary layer of Windows 2000 kernel-mode drivers and was introduced to increase the functionality and ease of writing drivers for Windows. Although WDM was mainly designed to be binary and source compatible between Windows 98 and Windows 2000, this may not always be desired and so specific drivers can be developed for either operating system."
Windows Driver Model,Device kernel-mode drivers,"With the Windows Drivers Model (WDM) for devices Microsoft implements an approach to kernel mode drivers that is unique to Windows operating systems. WDM implements a layered architecture for device drivers, and every device of a computer is served by a stack of drivers. However, every driver in that stack can chain isolate hardware-independent features from the driver above and beneath it. So drivers in the stack do not need to interact directly with one another. WDM defines architecture and device procedures for a range of devices, such as display and the network card, known as Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS). In the NDIS architecture the layered network drivers include lower-level drivers that manage the hardware and upper-level drivers that implement network data transport, such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).While WDM defines three types of device drivers, not all driver stacks for a given device contain all types of device drivers. The three WDM device driver types are:Bus driver: For every bus on the mainboard there is a one bus driver, with the primary responsibility for the identification of all devices connected to that bus and responding to plug and play events. Microsoft will provide bus drivers as part of the operating system, such as PCI, PnPISA, SCSI, USB and FireWire.
Function driver: this is the principal driver for a device and it provides the operational interface for a device by handling read and write operations. Function drivers are written by the device vendors, and for their interaction with the hardware they depend on a specific bus driver being present in the Windows operating system.Filter driver: This driver is optional, and can modify the behaviour of a device, such as input and output requests. These drivers can be implemented as lower-level and upper-level filter drivers."
Windows Driver Model,Object-oriented driver stack,"Function drivers and bus drivers are often implemented as driver/minidriver pairs, which in practice is either a class or miniclass, or a port or miniport pair.Bus drivers for devices attached to a bus are implemented as class drivers and are hardware-agnostic. They will support the operations of a certain type of device. Windows operating systems include a number of class drivers, such as the kbdclass.sys driver for keyboards. Miniclass drivers on the other hand are supplied by the vendor of a device, and only support device specific operations, for a particular device of a given class.Port drivers support general input/output (I/O) operations for a peripheral hardware interface. The core functionality of port drivers is mandated by the operating system, and Windows operating systems integrate a variety of port drivers.  For example, the i8042prt.sys port driver for the 8042 microcontroller connects PS/2 keyboards to the mainboard peripheral bus. The miniport drivers, like the miniclass drivers, are supplied by the hardware vendors and support only device specific operations of peripheral hardware that is connected to a port on the mainboard.Each driver that processes an I/O request for a device has a corresponding object, which is loaded into main memory. A device object is created by the Windows operating system from the associated device class. Device objects contain structures of type DEVICE_OBJECT, which store pointers to their driver. At run time these pointers are used to locate a driver's dispatch routine and member functions. In the WDM driver stack, the filter driver device object, known as the upper filter, will receive an I/O request packet (IRP) for a device from the I/O manager. If the upper filter driver can not serve the request, it will locate the object of the driver one step down in the driver stack. The IRP is passed down the driver stack by calling the function IoCallDrive(), and processed by the function driver device object, also known as functional device object. The function driver device object in turn may pass the IRP to the lower filter, another filter device object. Then the IRP may be passed down to the bus driver, which operates as the physical device object. The bus driver object is at the bottom of the driver stack, and interacts with the hardware abstraction layer, which is part of the Windows operating system kernel and allows Windows operating systems to run on a variety of processors, different memory management unit architectures, and a variety of computer systems with different I/O bus architectures. The execution of an IRP is finished when any of the driver objects in the stack returns the request back to the I/O manager, with the result and a status flag."
Windows Driver Model,Device drivers for different Windows operating systems,"The WDM framework was developed by Microsoft to simplify the communication between the operating system and drivers inside the kernel. In Windows operating systems, drivers are implemented as Dynamic Link Libraries .DLL or .SYS files. WDM compliant drivers must follow rules of design, initialisation, plug-and-play, power management and memory allocation. In practice WDM driver programmers reuse large pieces of code when building new object-oriented drivers. This means that drivers in the WDM stack may contain residual functionality, which is not documented in specifications. Drivers that have passed the Microsoft quality test are digitally signed by Microsoft. The Microsoft Hardware Compatibility Tests and the Driver Development Kit include reliability and stress tests.A device driver that is not designed for a specific hardware component may allow another device to function. This is because the basic functionality of a hardware device class is similar. The functionality of the video card class, for example, allows the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter driver to work with a wide variety of video cards. However, installing the wrong driver for a device will mean that the full functionality of the device can not be used, and may result in poor performance and the destabilization of the Windows operating system. Hardware device vendors may release updated device drivers for particular Windows operating systems, to improve performance, add functionality or fix bugs. If a device is not working as expected the latest device drivers should be downloaded from the vendor website and installed.Device drivers are designed for particular Windows operating system versions, and device drivers for a previous version of Windows may not work correctly or at all with other versions. Because many device drivers run in kernel mode installing drivers for a previous operating system version may destabilise the Windows operating system. Migrating a computer to a higher version of a Windows operating system therefore requires that new device drivers are installed for all hardware components. Finding up to date device drivers and installing them for Windows 10 has introduced complications into the migration process.Common device driver compatibility issues include: a 32-bit device driver is required for a 32-bit Windows operating system, and a 64-bit device driver is required for a 64-bit Windows operating system. 64-bit device drivers must be signed by Microsoft, because they run in kernel mode and have unrestricted access to the computer hardware. For operating systems prior to Windows 10 Microsoft allowed vendors to sign their 64-bit drivers themselves, assuming vendors had undertaken compatibility tests. However, Windows 10 64-bit drivers now need to be signed by Microsoft. Therefore, device vendors have to submit their drivers to Microsoft for testing and approval. The driver installation package includes all files in the .inf directory, and all files in the package need to be installed, otherwise the installation of the device driver may fail. For operating system versions before Windows 10 not all files necessary for the driver installation were included in the package, as this requirement was not consistently enforced. Some device driver installers have a user interface GUI, often requiring user configuration input. The absence of a user interface does not mean that the installation of the device driver is not successful. Besides, Windows 10 device drivers are not allowed to include a user interface. The Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) 10.x is used for network devices by the Windows 10 operating system. Network device drivers for Windows XP use NDIS 5.x and may work with subsequent Windows operating systems, but for performance reasons network device drivers should implement NDIS 6.0 or higher. Similarly, WDDM is the driver model for Windows Vista and up, which replaces XPDM used in graphics drivers."
Windows Driver Model,Device Manager,"The Device Manager is a Control Panel applet in Microsoft Windows operating systems. It allows users to view and control the hardware attached to the computer. It allows users to view and modify hardware device properties, and is also the primary tool to manage device drivers."
Windows Driver Model,Criticism,"The Windows Driver Model, while a significant improvement over the VxD and Windows NT Driver Model used before it, has been criticised by driver software developers, most significantly for the following:

Interactions with power management events and plug and play are difficult. This can lead to situations where Windows machines cannot enter or exit sleep modes correctly due to bugs in driver code.
I/O cancellation is difficult to get right.
Complex boilerplate support code is required for every driver.
There is no support for writing pure user-mode drivers.There were also a number of concerns about the quality of documentation and samples that Microsoft provided.
Because of these issues, Microsoft has released a new set of frameworks on top of WDM, called the Windows Driver Frameworks (WDF; formerly Windows Driver Foundation), which includes Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) and User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF). Windows Vista supports both pure WDM and the newer WDF. KMDF is also available for download for Windows XP and even Windows 2000, while UMDF is available for Windows XP and above."

Chipknip,Background,"In the early years of the PIN system, consumers were advised to pay small amounts with cash money and big amounts with PIN. Later, the cash was replaced by the Chipknip."
Chipknip,Proton,"The Proton system was designed by Banksys in 1994. It was licensed to banks in Switzerland, The Netherlands, Brazil, Australia, Sweden and Canada for their programs but used a different name for each of them. American Express got a worldwide license. Banksys invested around 1 billion francs in the development of Proton, which had paid off. Interpay avoided a significant investment by licensing the Proton system developed by Banksys. The Proton architecture is largely inspired by EN 1546, but the Proton protocol is proprietary."
Chipknip,Legal,"BeaNet was founded in December 1988. On 1 July 1993, a merger between Bankgirocentrale, BeaNet and Eurocard Nederland was announced, which formed Interpay B.V. in 1994.

Every payment product of Currence is put in a separate besloten vennootschap company. They are all owners of the trademarks, copyrights and other properties. These companies are contract parties with license and certification holders and are responsible for providing a licenses to other companies."
Chipknip,Characteristics,"The Chipknip was a debit card that did not require a pin code for payments. For depositing money onto the card, it did require a pin code. A maximum of 500 guilders or euros could be deposited onto the card.
A Chipknip transactions takes around 2 to 3 seconds.In Phase I, the card manufacturer was CP8 Transac, a division of Groupe Bull. In June 1996, the choice for the CC1000 chips by Bull Benelux was made. In Phase II, the national roll-out starting in 1996, the card was manufactured by CP8 Oberthur Technologies and Philips. From Phase III and onwards it was developed by CP8 Oberthur Technologies and De La Rue Card Technology. It was based on the Belgian system named Proton. It was compatible with multiple suppliers of readers and terminals: CCV Group, Certec, DateInet, Getronics, ICL, NCR, QE and Taxameter. In Phase I and II, it used the ST16601 chip by SGS-Thomson which had 1 kilobyte EEPROM. In Phase III, it used the ST16F48 by the same company which had an 8 kilobyte EEPROM. The ST16 series is based on the Motorola 6805. The ST16F48 uses an 8-bit micro-architecture and has serial access which is compatible with ISO 7816. The CMOS-based semiconductor is manufactured using the 1 micrometer process. The development for the chip is done using the ST16XYZ-EMU development system. The Chipknip network was based on the X.25 protocol. It made use of the Data Encryption Standard and the Triple DES with RSA using a secure access module. In 2011, Currence published about the rise of skimming with the Chipknip. Skimmers modified the device in such a way that information from the card could be read. Countermeasures were taken, such as front pieces in the ATM. In July of that year, Currence stated that the skimming was reduced to zero.The Chipper chip was manufactured by IBM and Schlumberger (of which the smart card spin-off Axalto later merged with Gemalto). It used the STM 16SF48 with 16KB of ROM, 1088 bytes RAM and 8KB of EEPROM. It used Triple DES for security."
Chipknip,History,
Chipknip,Pilot,"The Chipknip started as a pilot project by Interpay in the city of Arnhem on 26 October 1995.
Wim Duisenberg, then president of De Nederlandsche Bank which is the central bank of The Netherlands called the Chipknip a ""more or less revolutionary development"". The city of Arnhem was chosen because it was most representative of The Netherlands as a whole in market research. Professor George Hendrikse and Henk de Vries noted that the representativeness may be questioned because the Postbank was a major employer in Arnhem, which might have favored adoption.The payment limit was set at 35 Guilders.M. Roos, the director of the Centraal Bureau Levensmiddelenhandel said in NRC Handelsblad that the Chipknip was already outdated at its introduction and should not be used. Companies that were part of Vendex or Ahold did not join the pilot. Interpay director Stolwijk was surprised by this since they changed their opinion in a few days."
Chipknip,Countrywide,"As of January 2000, there were 12.500.000 cards in circulation.
Intellect CEO Graeme Inchley said in August 1996 that 2500 devices were ordered at their company for initial deployment.Banks advised using the Chipknip for payments up to 35 Guilders and PIN for payments up to 100 Guilders.In March 1996, Rabobank released their Smartfone to deposit money on the Chipknip from home, which cost 300 Guilders. In October 1996, Rabobank announced that they planned to make their Chipknip usable for internet payments. They ordered a million Chipknip readers from the company Datelnet from 's-Hertogenbosch and planned to release it in the first months of 1997. Using the so-called Chipknipper the balance could be read, the card could be locked and money could be deposited using a phone line. Once the card was locked, it could only be unlocked at a loading station.The countrywide deployment started at the end of the summer of 1996, a year earlier than originally planned.NRC Handelsblad noted in November 1996 that The Netherlands was an early adopter of electronic payments and that it was mainly beneficial for the banks themselves. The Royal Dutch Mint criticized the Chipknip for the aggressive marketing, forcing large transaction fees upon small and medium enterprises.As of 1997, over 30.000 VeriFone Smart Card systems have been installed by the Rabobank for the Chipknip.The  Dutch Advertising Standards Authority stated in 1997 that the Rabobank falsely claimed in commercials that the Chipknip already had millions users.As of January 2000, there were 12.500.000 cards in circulation.Rabobank marketed the Chipknip from 2001 at residents councils of retirement homes. A few years later, 350 retirement homes had implemented the Chipknip, also because Rabobank delivered a working ATM.In 2003, then leaving director of Interpay Willem Stolwijk said that the usage of Chipknip lags behind the expectations.In 2003, a lawsuit was filed against the municipality of Nijmegen who only allowed Chipknip payments at their parking meters. The verdict was ruled in favor of the lawyer who sued the municipality. German car-using customers avoided Nijmegen because they were unable to pay with anything except the Dutch Chipknip. A prepaid Chipcard was introduced by InterEGI (Interpay Elektronisch Geldinstelling B.V.) for foreigners who do not had a Dutch bank account.In 2004, Rabobank introduced voice controlled Chipknip deposit devices in retirement homes.On 4 March 2004, Interpay founded the spun off named Brands & Licences Betalingsverkeer Nederland, which would handle payment products so that Interpay could focus on transaction processing. On 17 May 2005, Currence was founded as a split-off from Interpay, who took over the Chipknip brand.As of 2006, there were 200.000 places where the Chipknip could be used, but this number also included locations where the Chipknip was deliberately made unusable by the merchant.Chris Hensen from NRC Handelsblad considered the Chipknip ""the Lada of the payment systems"".In 2006, Ilja Bruggeman from Platform Detailhandel Nederland did not blamed merchants for the low adoption of the Chipknip, because for them it would have been efficient, safe and cheap. He described the consumers as unwilling to make use of the system. Because they were unwilling, merchants did not installed it more widely, creating a vicious cycle.In 2007, migration to EMV was started, which made the chip compatible with both Chipknip and PIN.Most Dutch banks added the Chipknip chip to their standard payment cards, but the Postbank used separate cards for Chipknip and PIN. According to a spokesperson, this made it easier for people to lend their Chipknip card to other people due to the low risk.
The Chipknip is mostly used on places where it is the only usably payment method, such as parking meters, candy vending machines or company cantines."
Chipknip,Chipper,"On 20 April 1996, the Postbank formally left the Chipknip project. Sister company ING formally stayed in the Chipknip project, which was controversial.Chipper was founded by Postbank and ING Bank together with KPN Telecom.ING executive Marinus Minderhout worked on the development of the Chipper while he also was a commissioner at Interpay at the same time.In 1998, Postbank introduced the ThuisChipper (English: HomeChipper) to deposit money from home to the Chipper card. After discontinuing the Chipper in 2001, Postbank investigated if the ThuisChipper could be made compatible with the Chipknip, which was not the case. According to the Consumentenbond, consumers could get their money back.It was promoted with the slogan ""De toekomst heeft een Chipper op zak"" (English: ""The future has a Chipper in its pocket"").In 1997, it was already clear that the Chipper had failed. In Zeeland, an experiment with the Zeelandkaart was conducted, but in the rest of the country the Chipknip was widely used."
Chipknip,Transition to EMV and discontinuation,"In August 2007, the Nederlandse Vereniging van Banken announced that they have stopped promoting the Chipknip. In September 2007, Currence announced that they would be repositioning the Chipknip system to the parvenca market segment (portmanteau of parking, vending and catering).In December 2007, Mastercard announced that they planned to release a successor to the Chipknip on the Dutch market, called the Paypass, which was later rebranded to Mastercard Contactless.Currence was the owner of the PIN brand. They expected that with their marketing campaign het nieuwe pinnen (English: the new pinning) that merchants would drop support for the Chipknip.
In January 2011, Currence predicted that the usage of Chipknip would decrease, because merchants have to sign new contracts with their banks for EMV compatibility and chipknip is not bundled in the same contract anymore. Currence deciced to discontinue the Chipknip service in March 2013.As of March 2013, Chipknip was responsible for 2% of the retail transactions. The costs to keep Chipknip operating would increase because it has it has to abide European harmonisation regarding the Single Euro Payments Area. In April 2013, retail stopped accepting the Chipknip. The benefit of this is that customers no longer have to make a choice between Chipknip or Maestro and V Pay on the payment terminal.In November 2014, it was estimated that all 12 million Chipknip owners collectively had 70 to 80 million Euros stored on their cards. First, ING, ABN AMRO and Rabobank decided to withdraw money from the cards, but later Currence decided together with all other banks to do the same. Customers of ABN AMRO had 14 million euros of debit on the cards Rabobank customers had 27 million euros of money deposited on their Chipknip cards, 7 euros on average.Algemeen Dagblad noted that ""only elderly people will mourn at the discontinuation of Chipknip"", because it was still relatively commonly used in retirement homes.The company Magna Carta Chipcard Solutions published a Chipknip transaction log that occurred on December 31, 2014, at 23:59 and stated that this was ""with virtual certainty  the last Chipknip transaction made before the end date that was specified by Currence"".Currence cited the decreasing usage as the reason for discontinuing it, but in reality the system was never used that much.According to Jan van der Kolk from the company Automaten Centrale, not all vending machines have been replaced on time, which caused problems if the machines did not also accept cash. Because there was not yet a good digital replacement, devices that were made compatible with the Chipknip earlier were made compatible with cash money again although consumers had a preference for digital money. When Leiden University discontinued the Chipknip, they made coffee vending machine consumptions free until a replacement was deployed."

Populism in Canada,Overview,"In his 1981 Studies in Political Economy journal article, ""Populism: A qualified defence"", John Richards, a public policy professor at Simon Fraser University, said that there were elements of populism in the Liberal Party under Mackenzie (leader from 1873 to 1880) and Laurier (leader from 1887 to 1919); Pattulo's British Columbia Liberal Party during the 1930s; Liberal Party of Ontario under Mitchell Hepburn (leader from  1930 to 1942); the many socialist and labour parties leading up to the 1932 founding of the CCF; the Manitoba Liberal-Progressive Party; the Union Nationale in Quebec under Maurice Duplessis  (leader from 1935 to 1959); the early Diefenbaker Tory party; the federal NDP under Tommy Douglas (leader from 1961 to 1971); and, to some extent, the Liberal Party of P.

protest populist movements in the United States and Canada; the 19th century traditional, communal values, peasant populism admired by Russian intellectuals; authoritarian populism of regimes such Peronism in Argentina; and contemporary populism adopted by political leaders and parties to appeal to the ""shared interests of the people"" in contrast to those of the ""powerfully organized 'vested interests' and traditional 'old-line' politicians."" Richards traced a shift in the populist movement to the mid-1980s. He said that left-wing activists in North America shifted away from New Left politics in the 1970s. In Canada, some became active in unions, the New Democrat Party, and the Parti Québécois. The 1986 book Citizen Action said that in the 1960s and 1970s in the United States, American conservatism became ""imbued with right-wing populism""."
Populism in Canada,19th century,Anti-establishment populist politics became an important political force in 19th century Ontario amongst rural and working class political activists who were influenced by American populist radicals. Populism also became an important political force in Western Canada by the 1880s and 1890s. Populism was particularly strong in the form of farmer-labour coalition politics in the late 19th century.
Populism in Canada,20th century,Multiple important populist political movements were formed throughout Canada in the 20th century. Western Canada and the Canadian Prairies in particular were the source of origin of a number of Canada's populist movements in the 20th century.
Populism in Canada,United Farmers movement,"In 1921, both Liberals and Conservatives lost to the United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) in the 1921 provincial election. The United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) and United Farmers of Saskatchewan (UFS) were formed by Prairie farmers that rejected party-dominated parliamentary representation advocated a quasi-syndicalist system of functional representation in a delegate democracy. The UFA governed the province of Alberta from 1921 to 1935."
Populism in Canada,Social Credit (Socred),"The Social Credit populist political parties won provincial elections in three provinces—the 1935 Alberta general election under William Aberhart—Bible Bill—the 1952 British Columbia general election under W.A.C. Bennett , and in Québec in the 1961 election under Réal Caouette, who later formed his own party, the Creditistes. At the federal level both the Socred and Creditistes were represented in Parliament until 1980.In 1933, William Aberhart, also known as Bible Bill, formed the Social Credit Party of Alberta (Socred). The socred governed the province continuously from 1935 until the 1971 election, when the party lost to Peter Lougheed's Progressive Conservatives. The Social Credit Party of Alberta led by William Aberhart promoted the principles of social credit economics alongside a right-wing populist agenda and the party governed Alberta from 1935 to 1971. By the late 1930s with social credit financial reforms being unable to be carried out at the provincial level, Aberhart refocused the Alberta Social Credit party to attacking social welfare programs and state socialism. Ernest Manning took over the Alberta Social Credit party and office of Premier of Alberta from Aberhart and led the Alberta Social Credit party along a right-wing populist agenda that criticized both the social welfare programs and centralizing tendencies of the federal government of Canada."
Populism in Canada,Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF),"In 1932, in response to the hardships of the Great Depression, a coalition of labour, socialists, and progressives in Calgary, Alberta founded the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). Tommy Douglas, who became a social activist at the onset of the Depression, joined the new CCF and was elected as MP in the 1935 federal election.In his 1978 Canadian Journal of Political Science journal article, ""Populism in the United States, Russia, and Canada: Explaining the Roots of Canada's Third Parties"", John Conway said that CCF and Alberta's Social Credit were, to some extent, ""populist formations."" Conway said that the CCF is an example of a populist party that transitioned successfully into a democratic party—the New Democratic Party. He said that the NDP, which was formed in 1961, was modelled on European social democratic parties and Britain's and Australia's Labour parties."
Populism in Canada,Reform Party of Canada,"The Reform Party of Canada was a right-wing populist party that existed from 1987 to 2000. It was formed and led by Preston Manning, the son of former Social Credit Alberta Premier Ernest Manning. It was originally a Western Canadian protest party that captured the support of right-wing Western Canadians who were disillusioned with the federal Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and in particular its preference for resolving the grievances of Quebec over the West. It also drew support of right-wing conservative Canadians who were dismayed by the Progressive Conservatives' inability to deliver their promised tax cuts and spending cuts. In 1993, the Reform Party made a political breakthrough in electing large numbers of members of parliament."
Populism in Canada,21st century,"The People's Party of Canada has self-described as populist, and been described as populist by many journalists. Its leader, Maxime Bernier, refers to it as ""smart populism"", which is based on principles of freedom, responsibility, fairness, and respect, that speak for ""all Canadians"" and which do not appease special interest groups.Pierre Poilievre, who has been described as populist by some journalists, won the 2022 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election and became the leader of both the Conservative Party and the Official Opposition. Some journalists have compared Poilievre to American Republican populists such as Ted Cruz, while many journalists have dismissed these comparisons due to Poilievre's pro-choice, pro-immigration, and pro-same-sex-marriage positions."

British jazz,History,
British jazz,Early 20th century,"London, which long has sworn to shake off the fever, but still is jazzing
Jazz in Britain is usually said to have begun with the British tour of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1919. That stated, British popular music aficionados in the 1920s generally preferred the terms ""hot"" or ""straight"" dance music to the term ""jazz"". Jazz in Britain also faced a similar difficulty to Brazilian jazz and French jazz, namely it tended to be seen by figures of authority as a bad influence, but in Britain the concern that jazz was from the United States appears to have been less important than in France or Brazil.  Instead those who objected to it did so more because they deemed it ""riotous"" or unnerving. One of the earliest popular jazz dance bands was that of Fred Elizalde, who broadcast on the BBC from 1926 to 1929.
By the early 1930s, music journalism in Britain, notably through the Melody Maker, had created an appreciation of the importance of the leading American jazz soloists and was beginning to recognise the improvising talents of some local musicians. During the 1930s most British jazz musicians made their living in dance bands of various kinds. Jazz became more important, and more separate as its own genre. Louis Armstrong played residencies in London and Glasgow in 1932, followed in subsequent years by the Duke Ellington Orchestra and Coleman Hawkins. But local jazz culture was limited to London where: ""jazz was played after hours in a couple of restaurants that encouraged musicians to come in and jam for drinks"". The groups of Nat Gonella and Spike Hughes gained a profile within Britain early in the decade; Hughes was even invited to New York to arrange, compose and lead what, in effect, was Benny Carter's Orchestra of the time. Carter himself worked in London for the BBC in 1936. West Indian swing band leader Ken ""Snakehips"" Johnson and Leslie Thompson, a Jamaican trumpeter, influenced jazz in Britain, with the band fronted by Johnson – ""The Emperors of Jazz"" – being the first large Black band of note. Johnson went on to form one of the top swing bands in the country, known as ""The West Indian Orchestra"", which became the resident band at fashionable London venue Café de Paris, and it was here that Johnson was among those killed by a German bomb during the Blitz in the early days of the war."
British jazz,1930s,"The music of the pre-war jazz age became a major form of popular music via dance bands, and this was due to an earlier influx of Caribbean jazz musicians who had enriched the British swing scene. Significant pre-war jazz and swing artists include Coleridge Goode and Ken ""Snakehips"" Johnson a leading London figure who was killed by a bomb at the Café de Paris, London, in March 1941 during the Blitz, and trumpeter, Leslie Thompson."
British jazz,1940s and 1950s,"World War II led to an increase in bands to entertain the troops and these bands began to refer to themselves as ""jazz"" groups more often. The period also saw an increased interest in American musicians who also toured in military bands. The future leading alto-saxophonist Art Pepper was among the visiting American musicians at this time.
Caribbean ex-servicemen and women who had volunteered in World War II, embraced listening to jazz and Bebop music, with some forming their own quartets playing jazz including tenor saxophonist, Winston Whyte. In London, there were many Black jazz musicians playing in popular nightclubs around Albemarle Street in central London. Notable nightclubs and dancehalls in London included the Shim Sham, Hippodrome, the Q club, and Wiskey-A-Gogo (W.A.G club). Black jazz artists in Britain were paid lower than their white counterparts, and so some artists would arrange and sell compositions to white artists who would release them under their own name.
In Britain, jazz was developing in quite unique ways and the following period saw the emergence of a consciously Black and proud British jazz. Up until the 1950s, industrial action by the musicians' unions on both sides of the Atlantic made it difficult for musicians from the United States to perform in Britain. ""There was a hole that needed to be filled and black British jazz evolved to fill that void,"" says Catherine Tackley of the Open University.In 1948, a group of young musicians including John Dankworth and Ronnie Scott, focused on the Club Eleven in London, began a movement toward ""modern jazz"" or Bebop. Significant instrumentalists in this early movement were trumpeter-pianist Denis Rose, pianist Tommy Pollard, saxophonist Don Rendell, and drummers Tony Kinsey and Laurie Morgan. A movement in an opposite direction was revivalism, which became popular in the 1950s and was represented by musicians like George Webb, Humphrey Lyttelton and Ken Colyer, although Lyttelton gradually became more catholic in his approach. Trad jazz, a variant, briefly entered the pop charts later. At this point both streams tended to emulate Americans, whether it be Charlie Parker for Beboppers or Joe ""King"" Oliver and other New Orleans musicians for traditionalists, rather than try to create a uniquely British form of jazz.
During the 1950s mass emigration into the UK, brought an influx of players from the Caribbean such as Joe Harriott and Harold McNair, though some, among them Dizzy Reece, found the shortage of genuine jazz work frustrating - dance music remained popular - and migrated to the United States. British-born players too, including George Shearing, active on the London scene since before the war, and Victor Feldman also chose to move across the Atlantic to develop their careers. Several new jazz clubs were established in London in the 1950s, including the Flamingo Club.A domestic musicians' union ban, with the agreement of the Ministry of Labour, was initiated in the mid-thirties on visiting American jazz musicians, following successful visits from Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington. Appearances from across the Atlantic virtually ceased for 20 years. Despite this, Fats Waller was able to visit the UK as a solo 'variety' act in 1938. Lyttelton illegally evaded the ban by playing and recording in London with Sidney Bechet (supposedly on ""holiday"") in November 1949. The erratic availability of American records meant that, unlike the rest of Europe, British jazz aficionados had become unfamiliar with the most recent jazz developments in the music's country of origin. The restriction was gradually relaxed from the mid-fifties onwards with musician exchanges.
Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London, co-founded in 1959 by one of the earliest native proponents of bebop, was able to benefit from an exchange arrangement with the American Federation of Musicians (AFM), allowing regular visits from leading American players from 1961. Stan Tracey, developed his skills backing the visiting musicians as house pianist at Scott's club. In 1959, the Chris Barber Jazz Band scored a hit with a version of Sidney Bechet's ""Petite Fleur"" on both the US Billboard and UK singles charts (No. 5 and No. 3, respectively)."
British jazz,1960s and 1970s,"In the 1960s and 1970s, British jazz began to have more varied influences, from Africa and the Caribbean. The influx of musicians from the Caribbean brought to the UK shores excellent musicians, including the Jamaican saxophonist Joe Harriott. Firmly established as an outstanding bebop soloist before his arrival in the UK he went on to claim a leading spot in British jazz. Harriott was an important voice and innovator whose constant search for new ways to express his music was to lead to collaborations with fellow Jamaican Alpha Boys School alumnus trumpeter Dizzy Reece and St Vincent trumpeter Shake Keane. Harriott turned to what he termed ""abstract"" or ""free form"" music. He had been toying with some loose free form ideas since the mid-1950s, but finally settled upon his conception in 1959, after a protracted spell in hospital with tuberculosis gave him time to think things over. At first he struggled to recruit other like-minded musicians to his vision. Indeed, two of his core band members, Harry South and Hank Shaw, left when these ideas surfaced. He finally settled on a line-up of Keane (trumpet, flugelhorn), Pat Smythe (piano), Coleridge Goode (bass) and Phil Seamen (drums). Les Condon temporarily replaced Keane on trumpet in 1961, while Seamen left permanently the same year, his place taken by the return of the quintet's previous drummer, Bobby Orr. Harriot's subsequent groundbreaking album Free Form was released in early 1960, historically prior to celebrated American saxophonist Ornette Coleman's own experimental Free Jazz album. Harriott's free form music is often compared to Ornette Coleman's roughly contemporary breakthrough in the US, but even cursory listening reveals deep divisions between their conceptions of ""free jazz"". Indeed, there were several distinctive models of early free jazz, from Cecil Taylor to Sun Ra. Harriott's was another of these. His method demanded more complete group improvisation than displayed in Coleman's music, and often featured no particular soloist. Instead of the steady pulse of Ornette's drummer and bass player, Harriott's model demanded constant dialogue between musicians which created an ever-shifting soundscape. Tempo, key and meter always free to alter in this music, and often did so. The presence of Bill Evans-inspired pianist Pat Smythe, also gave the band a completely different texture to Coleman's, which by then had dispensed with the need for a pianist.
Harriott was always keen to communicate his ideas, be it on stage, in interviews or album liner notes. In 1962, he wrote in the liner notes for his Abstract album, ""of the various components comprising jazz today - constant time signatures, a steady four-four tempo, themes and predictable harmonic variations, fixed division of the chorus by bar lines and so on, we aim to retain at least one in each piece. But we may well, if the mood seems to us to demand it, dispense with all the others"".
He recorded three albums in this vein: Free Form (Jazzland 1960), Abstract (Columbia (UK) 1962) and Movement (Columbia (UK) 1963). Abstract received a five-star review from Harvey Pekar in Down Beat, the first such honour for a British jazz record. Free Form and Abstract together formed a pair of cohesive, trailblazing free jazz sessions. The next album, Movement, featured some of his most fiercely abstract compositions, but these were tempered by some other, more straight ahead pieces.
In 1962, Kenny Ball and His Jazzmen got US hit ""Midnight in Moscow"". One important aspect was the South African jazz musicians who had left their home nation, including Chris McGregor, Dudu Pukwana, Mongezi Feza, Johnny Dyani, Harry Miller and later Julian Bahula.
There was also a growth in free jazz inspired by European models more than from American music. It helped to influence the development of a strong European identity in this field. South African and free jazz influences came together in projects like the Brotherhood of Breath big band, led by McGregor. Added to this, more musicians had been raised on rhythm and blues or English forms of rock and roll, which became increasingly significant to the genre. These influences mixed in a way that led to British contemporary jazz of the time developing a distinctive identity distancing it to some extent from American styles. Highly original jazz composers such as Mike Westbrook, Graham Collier, Michael Garrick and Mike Gibbs began to make major contributions during the period and after. The local scene was not unaffected by, what elsewhere came to be known as, the British Invasion; the jazz audience was in numerical decline at this time. One branch of this development was the creation of various British jazz fusion bands like Soft Machine, Nucleus, Colosseum, If, Henry Cow, Centipede, National Health, Ginger Baker's Air Force, to name a few. Some of the most significant musicians to emerge during this period include John McLaughlin and Dave Holland (both of whom joined Miles Davis's group), pianists Keith Tippett and John Taylor, saxophonists Evan Parker, Mike Osborne, John Surman and Alan Skidmore, and the Canadian-born trumpeter Kenny Wheeler who had settled in Britain.
The Jazz Centre Society was founded in 1969 to develop a national centre for jazz in London and efforts to secure and fund premises for the centre continued until 1984; the JCS's many jazz promoting activities in London, Manchester, the Midlands and elsewhere survive as Jazz Services Ltd. Similar promotional organisations such as Platform Jazz in Scotland were formed in the 1970s to widen opportunities to hear and play jazz. The music continued to be presented in a wide range of venues in major British cities, but with most activity still focused in London. A National Jazz Archive was set up with its base at Loughton Library in Essex. Today it is the main location for jazz documentation in Britain, with rapidly expanding collections. John Keating's wife Thelma Keating recorded John Barry's song ""Follow Me"" in 1972."
British jazz,1980s to the present,"The 1980s saw a continuing development of distinctive styles. There was a new generation of Black British musicians who helped to re-energise the UK jazz scene, with Courtney Pine, Ronny Jordan, Gary Crosby, Julian Joseph, Cleveland Watkiss, Steve Williamson, Orphy Robinson, and later Denys Baptiste, Soweto Kinch and Jason Yarde being noteworthy examples (many of these musicians have recorded albums on historical labels such as Verve, Blue Note and are musicians who are highly regarded on the international scene. They were also members of the ground-breaking Black British big band Jazz Warriors). Loose Tubes was also very important group in re-energising the British scene. Many musicians from this band, including Django Bates, Iain Ballamy and Julian Argüelles, have also become important artists with highly developed individual musical voices. Early 1990s, acid jazz group such as Incognito and Brand New Heavies were popular.
The expansion of jazz was also marked by the launch of Jazz FM in 1990 and the opening of The Jazz Café, based in Camden Town, London. Both of these gradually ceased to concern themselves primarily with jazz and the radio station was renamed Smooth FM in 2005. A new national digital jazz radio station The Jazz began operations at Christmas 2006, dedicated to broadcasting jazz in most styles, but was closed by its parent company in February 2008. However, new venues continue to open.
In recent years, funk and hip hop have become an influence on parts of Britain's jazz scene. At the same time, Black British traditions in jazz have been strengthened, in part, by the ""rediscovery"" and celebration in the 2000s of Jamaican altoist Joe Harriott's once-neglected music and by the publication of books about him and his close collaborator, bassist Coleridge Goode. The effect has been to make Harriott, posthumously, a powerful symbol of Black British jazz achievement and identity. A new generation of electro-jazz artists such as K.T. Reeder have sought to redefine Jazz through using advanced computer software and acoustic instruments.
There are more opportunities now for students to specialise in jazz whether at basic learner level or at major conservatoires around the country, such as the Royal Academy of Music, Guildhall School of Music, Trinity College of Music and Middlesex University in London, Birmingham Conservatoire and Leeds College of Music. Jazz music education and artist development is also undertaken by organisations including The Jazz Centre UK, The National Youth Jazz Orchestra and Tomorrow's Warriors (founded in 1991 by Janine Irons and Gary Crosby, with alumni going on to win several awards.)."
British jazz,British jazz organisations,"The National Jazz Archive is the UK's primary archive of printed materials related to the history of jazz and related music in Britain and beyond. Founded in 1988, and based at Loughton Library, Loughton, Essex, it holds more than 4000 books and approximately 700 journals and periodicals, as well as photographs, drawings, paintings, concert and festival posters and programmes. Also included are letters, memorabilia and personal papers donated by musicians, writers, journalists and collectors. Among The NJA's special collections are the papers of Mike Westbrook, John Chilton, Jim Godbolt and Charles Fox.
The Jazz Centre UK is currently the only existing charity in the UK with the aim to establish national representation of the art form. Prior to The Jazz Centre UK only one unsuccessful attempt to establish such a centre had been launched in 1982 when plans were laid by the (then) ‘Jazz Centre Society’ to establish a National Jazz Centre in London's Floral Street, Covent Garden. However, the project collapsed four years later in 1986 due to problems with financial management. The Jazz Centre (UK) was officially launched thirty years later and registered as a charity on 2 June 2016 with the aim to preserve promote and celebrate the art of jazz music in all its forms."

British jazz,Jazz publications,"Jazz publications in the UK have had a chequered history.

Jazz Journal (known as Jazz Journal International, 1977–2009) was founded in 1947 and edited for many years by Sinclair Traill. It formerly tagged itself ""the greatest jazz magazine in the world"", but was thought to have ceased publication in January 2009. The holding company though absorbed Jazz Review around April 2009, and the magazine was revived at the end of that month, edited by Mark Gilbert.
Jazz Monthly (1955–71), edited by Albert McCarthy, had a particularly high reputation during its run and numbered many of the leading British jazz critics of the time among its contributors.
Jazz Review (1998–2009) was published by the music promoter Direct Music. A monthly, for most of its history, it was edited by Richard Cook, until his death in 2007. It was formally absorbed by Jazz Journal in April 2009.
Jazz UK has for many years been the main periodical specialising in news and features about jazz in Britain. Its former editors are Jed Williams and John Fordham.
Jazzwise is a monthly founded in 1997 that mainly covers modern and contemporary jazz.
Melody Maker, founded as a jazz magazine, had a notable proselytiser for the music in Max Jones on its staff, but it had abandoned its coverage of jazz by the late 1970s.
The Wire was founded in 1982 originally as a jazz magazine with contributions from Max Harrison and Richard Cook among others, but subsequently broadened its focus."

Frank W. Gunsaulus,Early life,"Frank Wakely Gunsaulus was born in Chesterville, Morrow County, Ohio, on January 1, 1856, the son of Joseph and Mary (Hawley) Gunsaulus. He was a descendant of Manuel Gonsalus (Gonzales), a Spaniard and early settler in Sullivan County, New York who lived near Rochester and married into a Dutch family in Kingston, Ulster County. His father, Joseph, was an attorney and notary public in Chesterville who was born on a farm in Cayuga County, New York on April 29, 1825. Frank Gunsaulus' oratorical skills, extraordinary memory and mental agility, impassioned leadership, and his dedication to civic duty, patriotism and democratic ideals can be attributed to the influence of his father.
In 1861, Joseph was elected as the Republican representative from Morrow County to the state legislature. He represented the county for four years, served on the Military Committee where he advised Governors William Dennison and David Tod during the Civil War, and was chair of the Committee on Municipal Corporations. He was mayor of Chesterville for 20 years, was one of its incorporators, was a member of its Council and was president of its school board. In 1854, Joseph married Mary Jane Hawley, who was born in Kentucky. Their two children were Frank Wakely and Lillian C., also born in Chesterville in 1862.
Frank W. Gunsaulus attended public schools in Chesterville and was admitted to Ohio Wesleyan University, Delaware, Ohio, at the age of 16. He was known by his classmates and professors to have a ravenous appetite for reading ""the classics"" coupled with a prodigious memory and a keen intellect. Always a popular student on campus, his classmates and professors were amazed by his public speaking skills and frequently made a point to attend his regular oratories at the school, where many claimed they were spellbound by his charm, wit, passion, and intelligence. He graduated from Wesleyan in 1875 at the age of 19 and was married that year to Georgeanna (Anna), daughter of George Long of Parsons, West Virginia and 1875 graduate of Ohio Wesleyan Female College."
Frank W. Gunsaulus,Early ministry,"After completing college, Gunsaulus was ordained to the Methodist Ministry and was an itinerant minister (circuit rider) for several years. In 1879, he entered the Congregational ministry and became pastor of the Eastwood Congregational Church in Columbus, Ohio, where he served until 1881. During this period, he and Georgeanne had three children: Joseph Long (1877), Martha G. (1879) and Beatrice (1881). He then served as a very popular pastor in Newtonville, Massachusetts, between 1881 and 1885 and at the Brown Memorial church in Baltimore between 1885 and 1887. While in Baltimore, Gunsaulus spent considerable time at the Johns Hopkins University Library and made contact with faculty members and students. He guest-lectured there on ""The Messages of the Great English Poets"" and later referred to the programs at Johns Hopkins as an educational model. During this period, he and Georgeanne added Mary J. (1884) and Helen C. (1886) to their family."
Frank W. Gunsaulus,Plymouth Congregational Church,"In 1887, Gunsaulus was called to the Plymouth Congregational Church in Chicago. At that time, the Plymouth Church had a mission Sunday school to which Joseph F. Armour, a noted and wealthy Chicago merchant, had contributed liberally. The mission, at 31st and State streets, had started in 1874, just three years after the Great Chicago Fire. When Joseph F. Armour died in 1881, he left $100,000 for his brother, Philip D. Armour, the wealthy meatpacker and grain merchant, to establish a Sunday school. Phillip D. Armour added another $100,000 of his own money and had the ""Armour Mission"" built.
The mission's members were to be non-sectarian without restrictions on race, creed or class. Just before Frank Gunsaulus arrived, about 700 new members joined the experiment in ""practical Christian democracy"" on its first Sunday in December 1886. Among the workers and teachers from Plymouth Church that assisted was Julia A. Beveridge, the mission librarian. Beveridge discovered that books were not enough to keep the members interested, so she started clay modeling classes. She soon added classes in wood carving, tile-making, freehand and mechanical drawing, and design."
Frank W. Gunsaulus,Armour Institute of Technology,"After Gunsaulus arrived in Chicago, he noted the effectiveness of Beveridge at the mission. He went on to preach a number of brilliant sermons to his affluent and influential neighbors, such as George Pullman and Marshall Field, about their social responsibility to the poor, uneducated, and unfortunate. In 1890, he delivered a classic sermon when Philip D. Armour was in attendance. Gunsaulus declared that if he had a million dollars, he would start a school to help the young prepare for work in the new industrial age. After the sermon (called ""The Million Dollar Sermon""), Armour approached Gunsaulus and offered to give him the money to establish a trade school for the practical arts and sciences if Gunsaulus would dedicate five years of his life to run it. Thus, in 1893, the Armour Institute of Technology (now the Illinois Institute of Technology) was established with Frank Wakely Gunsaulus as its first president. The school first offered courses in engineering, chemistry, architecture and library science. Gunsaulus continued to serve as president of the Institute until his death in 1921. In honor of its first president, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill designed Gunsaulus Hall near 31st and Michigan Avenue (completed in 1949), which provides housing for graduate students and their families. Scholarships and an alumni fundraising group are also named in his honor."
Frank W. Gunsaulus,Education philosophy,"Gunsaulus was an educational reform leader who influenced schools, institutions, and associations with a message often expressed as ""head, heart and hand."" Gunsaulus made appearances throughout the country, at commencement ceremonies and as a lecturer at colleges and universities, to spread his ideas about education.
With a firm belief that a democratic educational meritocracy was the best way to develop individually and as a nation, Gunsaulus wanted practical education to be spread among the masses to everyone who wished to learn. He believed in an orderly and disciplined universe; therefore, science and math appealed to him. He also recognized the importance of character in self-development. Ideally, he said, education should prepare one to perform in the service of fellow men, which requires instruction and discipline. During the process, students should also develop an appreciation for spiritual power, which inculcates values that are used to make sound judgments and restrain impulses.
An example of his philosophy put into action was the establishment of a four-year course in Fire Protection Engineering at the Armour Institute of Technology. Gunsaulus was convinced that the Great Fire of Chicago in 1871 could have caused less damage if fire prevention and protection were taken seriously. In cooperation with Underwriters Laboratories and the Western Actuarial Bureau, a scholarship fund was established and a curriculum developed for a new branch of engineering that incorporated noble goals in the service of mankind.
To honor his contributions to Chicago education, the Frank W. Gunsaulus Scholastic Academy was named for him. A back-to-basics magnet school that accepts students from throughout Chicago, the Academy received the School of Excellence Award in 2002."
Frank W. Gunsaulus,Lectures,"Gunsaulus was a tireless lecturer who not only delivered stirring sermons from his pulpit, but also traveled extensively throughout the country and England to speak by invitation at schools, churches, and many other public venues. In 1893, he was named divinity lecturer at Yale theological seminary and was professorial lecturer at the University of Chicago. He also lectured for many years at the Chicago Theological Seminary and McCormick Theological Seminary.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a form of circuit lectures, called Chautauqua, was formed initially to train Sunday school teachers. It later expanded into a series of lectures for rural Americans to provide stimulating thought and discussion about important issues. This forum was perfect for Gunsaulus who, along with other great orators of the day such as William Jennings Bryan, Maud Ballington Booth, Robert La Follette, Joseph Folk, and Hiram Johnson, provided culture and entertainment to small towns. Although few were transcribed, Frank Gunsaulus lecture titles included ""A Chapter in the History of Liberty,"" ""Savonarola,"" ""The Later Eloquence of Puritanism,"" ""The War Against the War,"" ""Oliver Cromwell and His Times,"" 'The Higher Ministry of Poetry,"" ""Rembrandt as an Interpreter of the Gospel,"" ""Robert Browning,"" ""The Next Step in Education,"" and ""Gladstone."" His favorite lectures were about William Ewart Gladstone, considered one of the greatest British prime ministers, and Girolamo Savonarola, the 15th century Dominican priest in Florence, Italy. According to Gunsaulus' friends, the Chautauqua chairman once said that he had ""the distinguished honor of introducing Mr. Savonarola, who would deliver his lecture on Gunsaulus."" Whether an innocent mistake or a friendly barb, the remark was deemed accurate by those who knew Gunsaulus well."
Frank W. Gunsaulus,Publications,"Gunsaulus is the author of fifteen books dealing with a variety of topics including poetry, music, history and Christianity as well as numerous contributions to periodicals. He was also editor-in-chief for technical books published for the American School of Correspondence at Armour Institute of Technology."
Frank W. Gunsaulus,Civic leadership,"Dr. Gunsaulus came to Chicago when the city was swept up with a sense of urban revival after the Great Fire of 1871 and civic pride sparked by the prospect of hosting an exposition to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Columbus' epic journey to the New World. Competing against other major U.S. cities, Chicago business leaders committed $5 million to the fair and promised another $5 million if the city were selected. Noting the success of the 1876 Centennial in Philadelphia, Gunsaulus was at the core of a small group of civic-minded leaders who promoted the fair as a means to push Chicago into the international spotlight as a center for commerce, education, architecture and the arts. The civic pride, unity, energy, and vision generated by the project is fondly remembered by Chicagoans who refer to this part of the City's history as ""the World's Fair period.""
Often called Chicago's ""First Citizen,"" Gunsaulus was involved in dozens of civic, educational, humanitarian and social enterprises throughout his residence in Chicago. In addition to guiding the early development of the Armour Mission, his ideas are credited with inspiring the founding of the Chicago Sunday Evening Club in 1907, a spiritual forum that eventually incorporated radio and television broadcasts that are still aired today by WTTW-TV, the Public Broadcasting Station in Chicago. He was also notably involved with the Illinois Industrial Training School for Boys, now called the Glenwood School for Boys and Girls. Gunsaulus lent his enthusiasm, leadership and advice in the school's early years. He also was involved in the YMCA, the Union League Club, the Brown University Club, the Church Federation of Chicago, the Chicago Congregational Ministerial Union, and parent-teachers organizations throughout the city."
Frank W. Gunsaulus,Collections and donations,"Gunsaulus was a very active collector of books and artwork. An avid reader, he collected many books, letters and autographs written by those who appealed to him. The Butler-Gunsaulus Collection at the University of Chicago contains 340 American and European manuscripts and letters by authors such as John Adams, William Cullen Bryant, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Horace Greeley, Washington Irving, Andrew Jackson, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, William Henry Seward, Frederick Douglass, and George Washington. Gunsaulus also donated valuable 13th-, 14th-, and 15th-century manuscripts to the Ohio Weslayan Library including works by Robert Browning, William Shakespeare, and Galileo; Roman papyri; illuminated hymnals, and an original King James Bible.
Gunsaulus also understood that art, especially art shared with the masses, was a practical means to give pleasure and inspiration, thus enriching the lives of many with whom it was shared. Gunsaulus actively promoted the advancement of fine art programs within an educational context and preached that art museums, libraries and laboratories should work with colleges and universities to share enlightenment and appreciation of art. To that end, Gunsaulus not only collected art, which he donated to various institutions, but he also worked with these institutions to ensure that it was shared with as many people as possible. He was a trustee of the Art Institute of Chicago for 13 years when the Institute built a new structure in time for the Columbian Exposition of 1893. In addition to donating his collections of Wedgwood and pottery of the Near East to the Institute, he also encouraged other Chicago citizens to donate their money and art collections to the Museum, notably Emma Hodge, Jane Bell, and Frank Logan. One donor, William H. Miner, was convinced to donate the money to The Art Institute and Gunsaulus wished to name the hall after Mr. Miner, but Will Miner countered that his donation of $50,000 for new galleries would be on condition that they be named in Gunsaulus' honor. From The Saturday Morning Herald, November 6, 1915 ""...It was Dr. Gunsaulus who pointed out to Mr. Miner the great need for a place for the objects of Industrial Art worth $225,000 which are now inadequately displayed. Mr. Miner refused to permit the gallery to be named after himself, asserting that the honor should go to one who has taken the greatest interest in building up the exhibit, and named the pastor of Central Church."" Gunsaulus Hall stands today as a two-story building that spans the Illinois Central railway tracks. The lower floor houses the Harding Collection of European arms and armor. The upper level contains galleries that contain modern and contemporary collections considered to be one of the finest and most comprehensive in the world."
Frank W. Gunsaulus,Public leadership and honors,"As a progressive social Chicago leader, Gunsaulus sought to influence public access to social institutions. He served as a board member of the Art Institute of Chicago (Gunsaulus Hall is named after him) and was founding board member of the Field Museum of Natural History where there is another Gunsaulus Hall. Gunsaulus held ""chair"" positions as a lecturer at Yale theological seminary in 1893 and professorial lecturer at the University of Chicago. He was named Merrick lecturer at Ohio Weslayan in 1921, but died before going to his former school. Honorary degrees bestowed on Gunsaulus include a Master of Arts by Ohio Wesleyan University in 1887 and a Doctor of Laws in 1905; a Doctor of Divinity degree by Beloit College (Wisconsin) in 1889; Doctor of Laws by Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, in 1908; and a Doctor of Laws by Marietta University in 1909."
Frank W. Gunsaulus,Political activities,"As a Christian crusader, civic promoter and educational reformer, Gunsaulus generally did not participate in political matters. However, he was called upon many times to express his opinions on important matters of the day, particularly those that involved moral issues. His key guiding principles were ""honor, tolerance, equality, and humanity."" Many times he brought guest lecturers to his pulpit at Plymouth Congregational Church or to the Armour Institute. Notables included Booker T. Washington, who implored students and church-goers to help solve ""the Negro problem."" Among other political friends he invited was President Howard Taft, who spoke at the 20th anniversary celebration at the Armour Institute.
Gunsaulus also spoke out for the freedom of Cuba in 1895 and for fair treatment of both Puerto Rico and the Philippines after the Spanish–American War. In 1908, he rebuked a religious issue in the 1908 Taft-Bryan presidential campaign (Taft's Unitarianism was harshly criticized) and used European history to point out the risks of religious bigotry. During World War I, Gunsaulus did not agree with critics who argued that the war proved that Christianity was impotent in providing moral guidance to national leaders. He believed that Christianity's gentle form of persuasion for liberty, brotherhood, goodwill and democracy, versus the rampant militarism that was killing millions, would ultimately triumph. Gunsaulus devoted much time to mobilize and shore up spiritual and moral forces behind the U.S. war effort, including speaking to soldiers before they shipped out to the European theater. He spoke out against pacifists and overly generous peace terms contemplated by President Wilson by replying rhetorically to Germany, ""Master of wanton states with madness bold, I cannot trust your word. Give me your sword!"""
Frank W. Gunsaulus,Death,"Dr. Gunsaulus died on March 17, 1921, at the age of 65 of heart failure. He suffered from several debilitating illnesses in his final years, but kept working at the Armour Institute while maintaining a demanding lecture schedule. His funeral was held at New England Congregational Church in Chicago on March 19. Officiating was Dr. Frederick F. Shannon, rector of Central Church. Dr. Shannon was assisted by Gunsaulus' brother-in-law, Dr. Clarence T. Brown of the Austin Congregational Church, and Reverend Charles W. Gilkey of the Hyde Park Baptist Church. He was buried at Forest Home Cemetery.
Gunsaulus' death was noted in newspapers throughout the United States and England. The New York Evening Post compared his oratory powers to Phillips Brooks and Henry Ward Beecher and his social Christian leadership to Jenkin Lloyd Jones and Dr. Washington Galdden. His pallbearers were Philip Armour (III), Eugene Thomas, Charles Stridiron, Alfred Hodge, George Allison, and Raymond Thornberg. The list of honorary pallbearers included J. Ogden Armour, Bernard E. Sunny, Frank C. Logan, Stanley Field, Martin A. Ryerson, Harry Pratt Judson, Charles L. Hutchinson, Julius Rosenwald, John Miller, Edward B. Butler, W. H. Miner, A. C. Bartlet, John S. Field, William C. Smith, R. H. Parkinson, Berthold Laufer, George M. Reynolds, Lester Armour, Dr. H. B. Thomas, David R. Forgan, Bishop Samuel Fallows, Dean H. M. Raymond, Dean Louis C. Monin, Dr. Graham Taylor, Dr. J. C. K. McClure, Dr. Frank Billings, Ex-Gov. Frank O. Lowden, Cyrus H. McCormick, Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, Victor F. Lawson, O. B. Taft, O. W. Wright, Bion J. Arnold, Rensselaer W. Cox, Dr. O. S. Davis, E. A. Bancroft, Frederick U. Smith, and E. D. Hulbert.
In a 1921 memoriam publication edited by Gunsaulus' wife, Georgeanna, Edgar A. Bancroft of the Illinois Bar Association remarked, ""No citizen has ever had a broader or clearer vision of the higher possibilities of Chicago in human development, or has done more to shape the forces to realize this vision. Truly it has been said: 'He was the first citizen of his city─the incarnation of its genius and the prophecy of its future.'"""

Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary,Geography,"The sanctuary, established on 14 January 1987 under Section 18 of the Wildlife Protection Act 1973, is spread over an area of 1,027.53 square kilometres (396.73 sq mi) It lies in an elevation range of 125–1,514 metres (410–4,967 ft) (“Ponnachi Betta” is the highest mountain in the centre of the sanctuary) with its northern and southern boundary delimited by the Cauvery River on the Eastern Ghats, which drains from west to east. Its eastern and northeastern borders are bounded by the Tamil Nadu state. The river forms the interstate boundary between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu states over a river reach of 73 kilometres (45 mi) with dense forests on both banks. The sanctuary is named after the Cauvery River which flows through it over a total length of 101 kilometres (63 mi).Important places along the river stretch flowing through the sanctuary covering its forested central and eastern parts are the Hogenakal Falls (meaning: ""smoking rock"" in Kannada language), Mekedatu (meaning: ""goats leap""), and Sangam (confluence with the Arkavathi River. An important religious centre within the sanctuary is Muthathi Anjaneya temple. Also located within the sanctuary are an ecotourism fishing resort and the Cauvery Fishing Camp at Bhimeshwari.The sanctuary is managed by the Deputy Conservator of Forests with four wildlife ranges at Kanakapura, Hanur, Cowdally and MM Hills wildlife ranges. The reserve forests, which are part of the sanctuary, are the Basavanabetta S.F (3,765.50 hectares (9,304.8 acres)), the Chilandavadi S.F (1,987.50 hectares (4,911.2 acres)), the Muggur S.F (2,044.00 hectares (5,050.8 acres)), the Chikkayalur S.F (13,875.00 hectares (34,285.9 acres)), and the Mahadeswara Reserve Forest (31,023.50 hectares (76,660.7 acres)). The boundary of the sanctuary is well demarcated with the surrounding border areas consisting of agricultural lands and forests; the bordering forest areas are: the Kollegal forest division to its west and south, Mandya and Ramanagaram forest divisions to its north, and Dharmapuri Forest division of Tamil Nadu state to its east.Human habitation inside the sanctuary and within 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) radius of the sanctuary consists of eight enclosed villages and 30 villages respectively with a total population of 39,000 whose main occupation is agriculture. Along the boundary of the sanctuary, a trench is excavated to prevent elephant migration to neighbouring villages and to check damage to agricultural lands."
Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary,Climate,"The sanctuary has a semi-arid climate, where the average temperatures are a minimum of 5 °C (41 °F) and maximum of 38 °C (100 °F), and during summer it touches a maximum of 40 °C (104 °F). The sanctuary receives rainfall both during the Northeast monsoon and Southwest monsoon. The rainfall varies between 750 millimetres (30 in) and 800 millimetres (31 in)."
Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary,Biology and ecology,"The sanctuary mainly consists of dry deciduous forest, southern tropical dry thorn and riverine forests. Hardwickia binata and Albizia amara are the dominant forest types. There is hardly any vegetation in the northwestern part while good forests exist in the rest of the sanctuary."
Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary,Flora,"The dominant species of trees found in this sanctuary are Terminalia arjuna and jambul (Syzygium cumini). Other tree species in the sanctuary are Albizia amara, Feronia sp., Tamarindus indica, Mangifera indica, Hardwickia binata, Acacia armata, and several other species of acacia, Feronia and Ficus."
Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary,Fauna,"It is home to mammals like the Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris), Indian elephant (Elephas maximus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), Indian leopard (Panthera pardus), dhole, spotted deer (Axis axis), barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak), sambar (Cervus unicolor), four-horned antelope (Tetracerus quadricornis), black-naped hare (Lepus nigricollis), chevrotain, common langur, bonnet macaque, honey badger (ratel) malabar giant squirrel (Ratufa indica maxima), grizzled giant squirrel (Ratufa macroura) which is under the highly endangered category in the state of Karnataka (but under IUCN Red List as near threatened), smooth-coated otter (Lutra lutra) The smooth-coated otter sites in the sanctuary’s river reach were specifically studied. It was noted that the otters inhabited riverine areas which were loosely packed sand and rock without compacted sand, rocks, gravel, and plant cover.The river Cauvery is also habitat for various species of reptiles like the mugger crocodile (Crocodylus palustris), Indian mud turtles (Chelonia sp.). Reptile species in the sanctuary are Indian rock python (Python molurus), Indian cobra (Naja naja), Russell’s viper (Daboia russelii) and banded krait (Bungarus fasciatus). This is also one of the few places to find the IUCN Red List Critically Endangered [1] hump-backed mahseer (Tor remadevii ) fish. It was also, previously, part of the distribution of the Critically Endangered [2] Nilgiri Mystus (Hemibagrus punctatus), known locally as haddu."
Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary,Avifauna,"The sanctuary is listed as an IBA assessed bird area by the BirdLife International in 2004 which extends over the same semiarid area as the sanctuary. The two most endangered species in the sanctuary are Gyps species of vultures – the white-rumped vulture (Gyps bengalensis) and Indian vulture (Gyps indicus). The four vulnerable species reported are Nilgiri wood-pigeon (Columba elphinstonii), greater spotted eagle (Clanga clanga), white-naped tit (Parus nuchalis) and yellow-throated bulbul (Pycnonotus xantholaemus). Other bird species reported are 25 species of Malayan Tropical Dry Zone which includes the near threatened red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus). Some notable resident species here include brown boobook (Ninox scutulata), white-bellied blue-flycatcher (Cyornis pallipes), stork-billed kingfisher (Pelagorpsis capensis), green imperial-pigeon (Ducula aenea) and Indian scops-owl (Otus bakkamoena).In a recent bird survey carried out in the sanctuary, reported in January 2014, the total number of bird species identified in the park are 280, which include 19 new species. Some of the notable species reported are: Indian courser, Malabar parakeet, large-billed leaf warbler, green leaf-warbler, western crowned leaf warbler, fairy-bluebird, the Indian blue robin, the yellow-throated bulbul, the crested goshawk, rosefinch, Blyth's swift, Orphean warbler, European bee-eater, and Eurasian crag martin.There is a very notable, disjunct population of lesser fish-eagles in the sanctuary. This species is harder to find elsewhere across peninsular India."
Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary,Threats,"The threats faced in the sanctuary have been recorded to be mostly of recent origin and of low intensity. These low level threats are related to farming and fishing activities, use of forest resources in the form of logging, tree harvesting, extraction of minor forest produce, least degree of recreational disturbance from human activities and low level of natural changes in the form of water harvesting structures. Upstream water impoundments have resulted in very low flows even in monsoon seasons, and dam releases introduce cold, low mineral content water at unpredictable times, all of which impact on riverine species. Still, the threats from exploitation of biological resources in the form of hunting and capture of animals is assessed as high.However, a damming project proposed at Mekedatu now comes as the biggest threat, as it would flood 12,000 acres of forest land, with 7,800 acres of land under the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary. This could severely impact the only large population of grizzled giant-squirrels in Karnataka and dwindle the already endangered population of the humpback mahseers and other fish endemic to this shallow riverine habitat. It could as well increase man-animal conflict in the forest regions north and south of the sanctuary, as the region is a vital elephant and tiger corridor. 
Introductions of alien fish species [3] have put huge pressures on the native fish, especially the most endangered species."
Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary,Conservation measures,"
Conservation measures in force in the sanctuary are in the form of patrolling on foot and in jeeps, and functioning of 11 moving anti-poaching camps; two permanent camps have been proposed. Drinking water to wild animals are provided through building of water conservation structures. Fire lines are cut and burnt well in advance before the beginning of the forest fire season; fire lines are created and dry material burnt. Fire watchers are stationed at strategic locations.: 17–22  A 10-year conservation plan for the period 2006–16 has been instituted. Zoning of forest into Core, Buffer, and Tourism zones has been planned. The tourism zone has four specific areas – Bheemeshwari and Muthathi, Sangam and Mekedatu in the Kanakapura Wildlife Range, Gopinatham and Hogenakal falls of M.M.Hills Wildlife Range. Administrative set up has been proposed to be reorganized with additional staff.: 32–37  Improvement of patrolling paths has been envisaged.: 48  To increase awareness among the general public publicity pamphlets are planned, apart from fixing signages and plaques with information on the importance of preservation of wildlife of the sanctuary.: 50

Igumnov House,The building,"It is the oldest building occupied by the French embassy, facing Yakimanka Street (No. 43) - Igumnov House - was built in 1883 – 1893 to the design by Nikolay Pozdeyev (1855-1893), and cost the architect his life. Igumnov family acquired the lot in 1851; in 1880 Nikolay Igumnov hired Nikolay Pozdeyev to rebuild the old two-story empire style mansion into a larger residence. Pozdeyev, a graduate of Imperial Academy of Arts, already had five years of practice as the town architect of Yaroslavl, where Igumnov had substantial investments in textile mills. Halfway through the project, in 1888, architect and the client agreed to discard the existing structure altogether and redesign the building from scratch; its dimensions, as built, increased to 45×33 meters. After 13 years of slow progress the building attracted public attention and became a target of numerous art critics, detesting its pseudo-Russian luxury; whether for this reason or due to sheer greed, Igumnov refused to compensate cost overruns to Pozdeyev; the ruined architect committed suicide in October 1893.After the October Revolution the nationalised building was taken over by a communal club, then by medical institutions. These included the Institute of Blood Transfusion established by Alexander Bogdanov in 1926. He lived there with his wife, Natalia Bogdanovna. Following his death, Natalia had Bogdanov's son move into her flat, the two of them remaining there until 1937.The Embassy of France has occupied it continuously since 1938. A larger, modernist Embassy structure (No. 45) was built on an adjacent block in 1979; since that year, Igumnov House became an official residence of the ambassador. In August 2007 the management of GlavUpDK, the state organization in charge of embassy buildings, announced a forthcoming restoration of the building, estimated to cost 10 million US dollars. Igumnov House is open to visitors once a year, on the International Museum Day."

Cheerleader (song),Background,"OMI—the stage name of Omar Samuel Pasley—was born in the parish of Clarendon, Jamaica. He grew up with a love of American hip hop, but grew more interested in melody after listening to singers like John Legend, Nat King Cole, and Sam Cooke. He first developed ""Cheerleader"" in 2008, when he woke up humming its melody. ""It was like a little Jamaican nursery rhyme, like 'one, two, buckle my shoe,' that kind of thing—'ring game' is what we'd call it. The rest of the song just fell into place like a jigsaw puzzle"", he later recalled. The following year, he was discovered by producer Clifton ""Specialist"" Dillon, an influential figure in the Jamaican music industry, who subsequently became his manager and collaborator. He originally wrote only two verses for the song, imagining it as an interlude for an album. Dillon convinced him to create a third verse, and the song began to take shape. Prolific Jamaican rhythm section Sly and Robbie and veteran saxophonist Dean Fraser contributed to the original recording, which was first issued in 2012 on Oufah, an independent label in Kingston.The following April, Patrick Moxey, president of U.S. electronic music label Ultra Music, discovered the song. According to Moxey, he was vacationing in Montreal when he first heard the song whilst listening to radio promoter showcase songs popular in the Caribbean. Meanwhile, Salaam Remi, an American hip hop producer that owned an imprint at Sony, was also interested in bringing the song to a wider audience. Ultra signed Pasley to a recording contract in late 2013. It soon began conversations with two disc jockeys—Brooklyn dancehall and hip-hop producer Ricky Blaze and German producer Felix Jaehn. They sent them ""Cheerleader"" and an a cappella version to build remixes. Jaehn enjoyed the song's vocals, but felt its instrumentation not attune to its ""feel-good"" essence; he hoped to craft a remix he deemed more ""danceable."" The Jaehn remix was completed in January 2014, and released that May on Ultra."
Cheerleader (song),Composition,"The remix version incorporates a house beat with additional trumpet, bongos and a ""samba-like"" piano part. It also speeds up Pasley's original vocal track, and eschews much of the original rhythm of the song with digital instrumentation. Fraser's saxophone is replaced by a sample of a trumpet. These attributes were considered more palatable for international audiences. Its genre has been variously described as representative of deep house, reggae fusion, and electro–ska.The song's lyrics center on the protagonist's joy at finding a ""cheerleader""—a romantic companion that will be a support system for him, and is ""always there when I need her."" While the song's lyrics relate heavily to romance, Pasley considered it timeless: ""It speaks to more than just a significant other. It's dedicated to anyone who is that support system."""
Cheerleader (song),Music videos,"The song's original music video, directed by Tim Cash, was shot in Oregon on a small budget. A second video, directed by Scorpio 21, was shot at Red Bones Café in Saint Andrew in January 2015.As the song began gaining worldwide success, a new music video for the Jaehn remix was commissioned. It was shot on location in Haulover Beach, Florida, which was designed to capture the song's essence, described by Pasley as a ""constant warm sunshine-playful vibe."" The clip was directed by Lenny Bass, who previously directed videos for Fantasia and Gavin DeGraw.As of August 2021, this music video of the remix has received over 1.1 billion views on YouTube."
Cheerleader (song),Chart performance,"The remix of ""Cheerleader"" was a gradual global smash single; it first topped charts in European countries before making its way to the United States. The original track was first placed on reggae charts in Hawaii and Dubai in 2012, after which it became a hit in his home country of Jamaica. Dillon ""strategically planned"" the song's rise to fame, having released the song to ""community sound systems in Miami and disc jockeys that toured with [Italian reggae artist] Alborosie.""Upon its remix, the song began gaining traction in Swedish markets, first through the streaming service Spotify. It soon spread to Italy and France. In January 2015, Sony Music, the conglomerate that owns Columbia and Ultra, named it their ""Song of the Month""; as a result, all subsidiaries of the company put forth additional promotion of the single. By that time, the song had peaked at number one in five European territories.
In March, a deal was signed with Syco Music, a label owned and operated by British music mogul Simon Cowell, to promote and distribute the song throughout the United Kingdom. The song's popularity on streaming media in the UK brought forth its official release date there to mid-April. It shortly thereafter debuted on the country's pop charts and was assisted by a viral video of Cowell singing the song. By early May, the song had topped the UK Singles Chart; four weeks in, it broke chart records as the longest-running single by a Jamaican artist.The song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States in early May, as the song peaked in the UK. The release of a revised music video to the song catapulted it to the top of music identification application Shazam's worldwide charts. Application data predicted that the song would top the Hot 100 at some point; the song eventually reached number one in the U.S. on 13 July. It remained on the top of the chart for six non-consecutive weeks, until finally being replaced by The Weeknd's ""Can't Feel My Face"". It was later named Billboard's Song of the Summer.
Much of the song's rise to prominence was attributed to its performance on streaming services. On Spotify, the song attracted over 910 million plays (as of January 2019). Outside of national charts, it peaked at number one on the iTunes Store in over 55 markets. ""Cheerleader"" was the most streamed song of 2015 in the UK, racking up 71.7 million streams throughout the year."
Cheerleader (song),Reception,"While Chris Molanphy of Slate found the song's lyrics ""laughably retrograde"", he praised the chorus as ""universally relatable and cross-culturally memorable.""Nick Messitte, a Forbes contributor, opined that the song has brought deep house music into the mainstream of the United States."
Cheerleader (song),Usage in media,"The song can be heard in the 2017 animated film The Emoji Movie, when Gene and Jailbreak enter Spotify. The song is also used as the background music for a 2018 Toyota C-HR commercial and a 2022 Stelara commercial.
The song was performed by the child actors of ABS-CBN Raikko Mateo, CX Navarro, Josh de Guzman, Enzo Pelojero and Simon Pineda on ASAP on 19 November 2017.The track appears in the streaming service, Just Dance Unlimited, as an exclusive for Just Dance 2016."

Let's Bowl,Overview,"Hosts Steve ""Chopper"" Sedahl (himself) and Wally Hotvedt (Rich Kronfeld) wore outfits and headsets reminiscent of sportscasters of the 1970s and early 1980s, and did play-by-play as contestants bowled against each other. Described as a cross between The People's Court and Bowling for Dollars, the show had participants play against each other to settle feuds and win nearly worthless prizes. For example, in the second 1998 episode, a player received merchandise for a radio station that had been defunct for two years. Gift certificates for Old Country Buffet were common that year. Another episode gave a foodservice-sized can of tuna to the runner up, while the winner received a 21⁄2 gallon consumer-strength jug of Roundup.
Two women known as the ""Queen Pins"" were on each show — while women are often used to provide visual stimuli in TV programs, these two acted differently, usually taunting the contestants as they tried to compete. Drew Jansen played unctuous Announcer/Musical Commentator Ernie Jansen (aka ""Trip Stuyvesant"" in the original pre-cable pilot).  The pre-cable pilot was shot at Bryant-Lake Bowl in Minneapolis, and featured yet another host, played by John Brady.  Brady's name in the pilot was ""Ernie,"" but that name was transferred to Jansen when shooting resumed, primarily because the polyester jacket Brady sported with ""Ernie"" stitched on the lapel fit Jansen pretty much as well as it had Brady.
Another character in the show was ""The Pig"" played by Matt Sarazine. The original shows, pre-Comedy Central also featured ""Butch the Janitor"", played by Nick Schenk, and ""Berni the Scorekeeper"", played by Berni Sarazine. Schenk went on to become one of the writers for the Comedy Central episodes of Let's Bowl and also wrote the screenplay for the film Gran Torino.
The show also included a halftime performance by a local musical band, most notably Ruth Adams and the World's Most Dangerous Polka Band, a fixture from northeast Minneapolis. It would be followed by a special ""Inside Bowling"" segment where Chopper and Wally interviewed unusual people and participated in bizarre escapades. Michael J. Nelson of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (also produced locally in the Twin Cities) fame was one of the writers for the show, both in 1998 and during the run on Comedy Central (though possibly only for the pilot).The series was filmed in several different bowling alleys in the Twin Cities. Outside of the region, the 1998 season was carried on stations in markets such as Reno, Nevada; Madison, Wisconsin; and Chicago, Illinois."

Transferable development rights,Description,"The TDR process can be considered a tool for controlling urban sprawl by concentrating development. TDR is a legal mechanism offered in some local government jurisdictions as a form of development control. In the United States, TDR are also a way to avoid constitutional takings issues caused by rezoning areas that would otherwise eliminate a significant amount of value from the property. The procedure offers landowners financial incentives or bonuses for the conservation and maintenance of the environmental, heritage or agricultural values of their land. TDR is based on the concept that with land ownership comes the right of use of land, or land development. These land-based development rights can in some jurisdictions be used, unused, sold, or otherwise transferred by the owner of a parcel.: 3  Sending districts are commonly made up of areas with desirable traits that are at risk of being developed such as agricultural lands or wilderness areas, but may also be newly designated historic sites. Alternatively, parcels with buildings that do not use all of their available size have ""excess"" developable capacity that can be conveyed to other parcels, possibly adjoining the first parcels.Receiving districts are typically are located in urban areas that are ripe for development. Receiving districts are generally areas more suited for higher density developments and sending districts are areas with environmental, heritage or agricultural values that the county, city or town wishes to preserve.TDR credit banks can be used to store development rights that have been purchased, if a receiving area development project has not yet been identified. This mechanism is used when the time of the sale in the sending area is not concurrent with a development in the receiving area. It is also useful in communities that have the opportunity to purchase the rights from an area of high conservation interest but do not have a development project that can receive higher density at the time. In Massachusetts it is recommended that TDR credit banks be operated by a third party organization that is empowered to negotiate the sale of development rights, such as a non-profit organization or an agency operating within the community."
Transferable development rights,Notable examples,"A widely-noted example of districted TDRs is the Montgomery County, Maryland Agricultural Reserve. TDR programs have been implemented in over 200 U.S. communities,: 25  in several states, including Colorado, Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington. New York City has limits to the air rights of each building, but those are freely transferable.One of the most famous examples of a TDR is in the case of Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City (1978). The United States Supreme Court held that the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission did not deny the owners of Grand Central Terminal all economic value by denying them the right to build an office building above the station. The terminal owners possessed air rights which could be used as a TDR to build higher than the conventional zoning allowed on their other properties."

John Brugman,Biography,"Brugman was born at Kempen in the Electorate of Cologne, towards the end of the preceding century; died at Nijmegen, Netherlands, 19 September 1473.
Brugman became a lector of theology, Vicar Provincial and one of the founders of the Cologne Province of the Observants, a reformed branch of the  Friars Minor. For twenty years his name was celebrated as the most illustrious preacher of the Low Countries. The saying still exists in that region, ""to speak like Brugman"", meaning to speak eloquently. A friend of Denis the Carthusian, it was at his suggestion that the latter wrote his work: De doctrinâ et regulis vitae Christianæ, dedicating it to Brugman.
Brugman also supported the foundation of the Brothers of the Common Life, a congregation, devoted to the interests of education, established by two priests, Gerhard Groote and Florentius Radewiyns. He addressed them in the two letters which are still extant to strengthen them in the persecution to which they were subjected.
Brugman died in the odour of sanctity and is commemorated in the Martyrologium Minoritico-Belgicum on 19 September."
John Brugman,Works,"Brugman wrote two lives of St. Lidwina, the first of which, printed at Cologne in 1433, was reprinted anonymously at Louvain in 1448. The second life appeared at Schiedam in 1498. Both included by the Bollandists in the Acta Sanctorum for 2 April.
Brugman also wrote a devout ""Life of Jesus.""
Brugman ranked among the best poets of his day. Two of his poems ""O Ewich is so lanc!"" and ""The Zielejacht"" are included by Hoffmann von Fallersleben in his ""Horae Belgicae"" (II, 36, 41.).
Brugman's life was written by Willem Moll under the title ""Joannes Brugman en het Godsdienstegen Leven Onzer Vaderen in de Vijftiende eeuw"", and published at Amsterdam in 1854. It consists of two volumes, the second containing Brugman's unedited works."

Gene DiNovi,Biography,"DiNovi was born in New York City. He worked with Joe Marsala and Chuck Wayne while a teenager. He was very active live and on record in the late 1940s, working with Buddy DeFranco, Benny Goodman, Chubby Jackson, Brew Moore, Boyd Raeburn, Buddy Rich, Artie Shaw, Lester Young. He worked extensively as an accompanist for vocalists, starting with Peggy Lee in 1949–1950; he also played behind Tony Bennett and Anita O'Day. He recorded with Lena Horne multiple times in the late 1950s and early 1960s and also accompanied her on tours of Europe. During this time, he also worked with his own small groups; his sidemen included Danny Bank, Johnny Carisi, Bill Crow, Tony Fruscella, and Dave Schildkraut. He began working more as a studio musician and film score composer in the 1960s. Toward the end of the decade he played with Carmen McRae, then moved to Canada to take a position as a house pianist with the CBC in Toronto. In the 1980s he worked with Ruby Braff and toured and recorded in Japan, and continued to be active as a performer into the 1990s, working with James Campbell, Don Thompson, Memo Acevedo, Dave Young, and Terry Clarke.DiNovi's daughter is the film producer Denise Di Novi."

4-Digits,4D,"The 4-D game is believed to have originated in Kedah in 1951, based on evidence during a gambling trial in a Singapore court in 1956.A schoolboy decided to raffle his bicycle for 100 $1 tickets, each bearing two digits. The winner would be the one whose ticket number matched the last two digits of the first prize ticket in a Malaysian Turf Club sweepstake. This led to the 2-D lottery, which in turn gave rise to 3-D and later, 4-D, betting games which were wildly popular in Singapore and Malaysia from the 1950s.The Singapore Turf Club was the first to introduce the 4-D draw in Singapore in May 1966, offering a S$2,000 first prize for a $1 ticket. It stopped offering it in May 2004 when its sister company Singapore Pools took over all the draws.
Singapore Pools launched computerised betting for 4-D on 31 May 1986, and it got off to an auspicious start when the winning number for the first prize in the inaugural draw turned out to be 8838. The number ""8"" sounds like fa (Chinese: 发) or ""prosper"" in Mandarin and is traditionally a favourite among punters. Punters welcomed the new 4-D product and the company's turnover that year increased 215%, to over S$283 million."
4-Digits,Methods of play,"Ordinary entry refers to a specific number. Example: 1234. 4-D Roll substitutes any one of the four digits with 'R'. (i.e. R123, 1R23, 12R3 and 123R) where 'R' denotes all digits from 0 to 9. Only one digit can be substituted with 'R'. For example, if you mark R234, you are actually buying 10 Ordinary Entries (i.e. 0234, 1234, 2234, 3234... 9234). System entry is a bet on all the possible permutations of a 4-D number, for example the number 1234 has 24 permutations (1234, 2341, 3412, 4123...). iBet is a System Entry bet priced from $1, regardless of the number of permutations. Quick pick is bet on a random number selected by a computer."
4-Digits,Variances,
4-Digits,Singapore,"In Singapore, 4-D draws are conducted every Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday at 1830h (SG/HK Time) at Singapore Pools' main branch at 210 Middle Road. Anyone above the age of 18 can attend the draws.
An independent external auditor and five draw officials are involved in the draw process. Before the draw, a specially designed computer is run to randomly select the draw machine and the set of draw balls to be used. A backup machine is also chosen.
The selected draw balls, numbered 0 to 9, are weighed to ensure that their individual weights are within an acceptable margin of error. This is to ensure that each ball has practically the same chance of being drawn.
The selected machines, secured under lock and numbered seal in a storage room, is transferred to the draw hall, along with the balls.
The balls are loaded into the draw machine in front of the audience. A member of the audience is then invited to press the start switch on the control panel, launching the draw. The balls in the draw machine, made up of four transparent cylinders, spin until a ball is sucked into a groove found in each cylinder.
The drawing process, starting from the consolation prizes, is repeated until all 23 sets of winning numbers are drawn."
4-Digits,Malaysia,"In Malaysia, there are four main 4D providers – Sports Toto, Magnum 4D, Derby Blue and Derby Green and Da Ma Cai. Da Ma Cai is run by Pan Malaysian Pools Sdn. Bhd. All 4 are independent private companies accredited and approved by Government of Malaysia.  These 4D operators are known as Number Forecast Operators.
Malaysia 4D draws daily and some on every Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday, which coincide with Singapore's 4D draw.  However, sometimes, there will be a special draw on Tuesday.
Magnum 4D offers the classic 4D game – the player picks a 4 digit number and chooses the amount he wants to bet. There are ""Big"" and ""Small"" Forecasts. A ""Small"" bet will warrant higher winnings, but the player will only win if his number comes up in the first, second or third places. The winnings are lower for a ""Big"" bet, but in addition to the first, second and third places, there are 10 ""Special"" numbers which pay RM180 for a RM1 bet, and 10 ""consolation"" numbers which pay RM60 for a RM1 bet. Magnum is the first legalised 4D operator to be awarded the licence by the Malaysian Government. In September 2009, Magnum introduced a new game which is an extension of the popular 4D game but with a parimutuel element; this game was copyrighted by Magnum. This game is more popular than the other Lotto games in Malaysia, and This year best number for 1st prize is 8734.
Da Ma Cai (大马彩; literally ""Pan-Malaysia Lottery"" in Mandarin) has a 3D game as well as 4D (which they call 1+3D). Unlike the 1+3D, the 3D only has first, second, and third places. Prizes are significantly lower than 1+3D, the top prize being RM660 for Big First place. Their 1+3D follows the same structure as the Magnum 4D. Da Ma Cai also have 3D and 1+3D Jackpot Games. The latest product introduced from Da Ma Cai is Da Ma Cai Jackpot in January 2014 with a minimum payout of 1.8 million for Jackpot 1. In December 2016 Da Ma Cai provide mobile betting channel ""dmcGO"" apps (IOS and Android)
Sports Toto, in addition to the basic 4D played the same way as Magnum and Da Ma Cai, runs 5D and 6D games as well. Unlike 4D, 5D and 6D do not have ""Big"" and ""Small"" Forecasts. First prize for 6D is RM100,000 and first prize for 5D is RM15,000. If the last 4, 3, or 2 digits of your 5D number (or the last 5, 4, 3, or 2 digits of your 6D number) match the first prize number, you still get a prize. Sports Toto also offers three lottery games, similar to those seen in Western countries. These are Mega Toto 6/52, Power Toto 6/55 & Supreme Toto 6/58. The last number indicates the highest number – Mega Toto 6/52 requires the player to pick 6 numbers from 1 to 52. The Supreme Toto 6/58 has the highest prizes (first prize is a minimum of more than RM8.8 million) but the probability of winning is lower than the others games as there are more numbers.
WTL-M Daily Derby 4D and 5D Jackpots is almost the same as the above three. It runs 4D and 5D games. 4D's are daily and monthly two 5D's. The prize structure is like One first prize, One second prize, One third prize, Ten Special and Ten consolation prizes.

Anglo-Saxon charters,Survival and authenticity,"The Anglo-Saxon charter can take many forms: it can be a lease (often presented as a chirograph), a will, an agreement, a writ or, most commonly, a grant of land. Our picture is skewed towards those that regard land, particularly in the earlier period.  Land charters can further be subdivided into royal charters, or diplomas, and private charters (donations by figures other than the king).
Over a thousand Anglo-Saxon charters are extant today, as a result of being maintained in the archives of religious houses. These preserved their charters so as to record their right to land. The oldest extant original charter, now in Canterbury Cathedral archive, was issued in 679 by King Hlothhere of Kent granting land to the Reculver Abbey. Some surviving charters are later copies, which sometimes include interpolations.Anglo-Saxon charters were sometimes used in legal disputes, and the recording of the contents of a charter within a legal document has ensured the survival of text when the original charter has been lost. Overall, some two hundred charters exist in the original form, whilst others are post-Conquest copies, that were often made by the compilers of cartularies (collections of title-deeds) or by early modern antiquaries. The earliest cartularies containing copies of Anglo-Saxon charters come from Worcester, early-11th-century Liber Wigorniensis and Hemming's Cartulary of a century later; a much later example, Wilton Cartulary, compiled in the mid-13th century at Wilton Abbey, still includes a significant amount of Anglo-Saxon material.The importance of charters in legal disputes over land as evidence of land tenure, gave rise to numerous charter forgeries, sometimes by those same monastic houses in whose archives they were preserved. The primary motivation for forging charters was to provide evidence of rights to land. Often forging was focussed on providing written evidence for the holdings recorded as belonging to a religious house in the Domesday Book. It is important when studying charters to establish their authenticity.  The study of charters to determine authenticity gave rise to diplomatics – the science of ancient documents.
Relatively few charters survive in their form as single sheets, and copies may have been altered for various purposes. Historians attempt to extract useful information from all types of charters, even outright fabrications, which may be of interest because they are apparently based on genuine documentation or for some other reason. Timothy Reuter, a specialist in German history, complained that ""Anglo-Saxon diplomatists persist in the belief that it is possible to be slightly dead or slightly pregnant"", but Simon Keynes argues that it is unhelpful to adopt the perspective of students of Continental charters, more of which survive as originals.Anglo-Saxon charters are catalogued in Peter Sawyer's Annotated List (1968), revised and extended online. They are usually referred to in the specialist literature by their Sawyer number (e.g. S 407)."
Anglo-Saxon charters,Charter forms,"The three most common forms of Anglo-Saxon charter are diplomas, writs and wills. They are certified by the attestations of witnesses, who are listed at the end of the charter."
Anglo-Saxon charters,Diplomas,"The largest number of surviving charters are diplomas, or royal charters, that granted privileges and rights, usually over land. The typical diploma had three sections: protocol, corpus, and eschatocol. The protocol opened the charter by invoking God and enumerating the pious considerations for the King's act (proem). The corpus was usually in Latin and named the beneficiary, recorded the grant or transfer (dispositive clause), reserved common burdens (reservation clause) and invoked the wrath of God on anyone who failed to observe it (anathema or sanction). The corpus' final section, which was often in Old English, described the boundaries of the land (boundary clause). The eschatocol was composed of a dating clause and witness-list, which usually included powerful lay and ecclesiastical members of the king's court.
Much of the language of the diploma was explicitly religious – that a grant was made for the benefit of the grantor's soul or that anyone breaking the charter would be excommunicated. Charters typically opened by situating themselves firmly within the Christian order, with a pictorial (cross, chrismon or alpha-omega) and a verbal invocation to God. Many early charters were granted in anticipation of the founding of a monastery. The document served a largely secular purpose – to document the legal possession of land and to free that land from certain duties that would otherwise be attached to it."
Anglo-Saxon charters,Writs,"The second most common form of Anglo-Saxon charter, although far fewer in number than the diploma, is the royal writ. These differed from the diploma in both form and function. A writ was an instruction from the king to a named official or group of recipients. It started with a greeting and was authenticated by a royal seal. The writ did not require witnesses and was often written in Old English.  Under the Normans, the use of writs was extended to cover many other aspects of royal business and was written in Latin. Florence Harmer provided the text (and translation when written in Old English) of 120 pre-Conquest royal writs."
Anglo-Saxon charters,Wills,"Anglo-Saxon wills were intended to make gifts of property (including land) after the writer's death, but they were not wills in the modern sense.Wills are rarer than writs. The first dedicated study, Anglo-Saxon Wills by Dorothy Whitelock was able to identify 39 documents. The number grew to 55 with publication of another 16 among the Anglo-Saxon Charters by Agnes Jane Robertson in 1939. Since 1939, contributions to the list were few and far between; in her 2011 Wills and Will-making in Anglo-Saxon England Linda Tollerton published the most up-to-date corpus, with 68 examples in total. The surviving documents are very unevenly distributed both in time and space: from the 9th century, for example, only 9 wills are known, and 6 of them are in  Canterbury. Not a single will from any period is known from further North than Burton upon Trent in Staffordshire. Furthermore, only 22 wills can be found in manuscripts written before 1066; originals are even rarer, as some, like those of Alfred the Great or Wulfric Spot, are known to be pre-Conquest copies, while still other may in fact be mere extracts or ancient forgeries.Only two wills of kings have been preserved, those of Alfred and Eadred, both in later copies. Anglo-Saxon women whose wills survive include Wynflæd (mother of Ælfgifu of Shaftesbury and grandmother of Kings Eadwig and Edgar), King Edmund I's second wife Æthelflæd and her sister Ælfflæd."
Anglo-Saxon charters,Boundary descriptions,"A typical royal diploma had a clause describing the boundaries of the territory that is the subject of the charter. There are also boundary descriptions in a number of leases and two wills. In the earliest examples, these boundary descriptions are short, in Latin and with few boundary points. In time, the descriptions became longer, more detailed and written in Old English. By the end of the 9th century, all boundary clauses were written in Old English. Many charters, particularly those that have survived in later copies, do not have boundary clauses. In some instances, space has been left for a boundary clause that was never copied. A few boundary descriptions survive that do not appear to be related to any surviving charter.
The content of these boundary descriptions varied, but in many instances these descriptions revealed the Anglo-Saxons' ideas about their landscape."
Anglo-Saxon charters,Historical significance,"Charters have provided fundamental source material for understanding Anglo-Saxon England that complements the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and other literary sources. They are often used by historians as sources for the history of Anglo-Saxon England. It was frequently kings who gave land in charters. By seeing what land was awarded, it is possible to see the extent of a king's control and how he exercised his power. In 846, Æthelwulf of Wessex granted land in Devon by charter, perhaps dividing the spoils from this recently conquered territory among his men.
Charters give lists of persons that attested the document and so it is possible to see who was present at the king's court. The very detailed diplomas drafted by the scribe known as ""Æthelstan A"" show that several Welsh kings, including Hywel Dda, attended the court of Æthelstan in the late 920s and the 930s. A person's absence from court can be equally revealing: Wulfstan I, Archbishop of York from 931 to 956, failed to attest any royal charters between 936 and 941, during which time the Battle of Brunanburh was fought between Æthelstan and an alliance of the Hiberno-Norse king of Dublin, Olaf Guthfrithson and the Scottish king, Constantine. Wulfstan was rather independently-minded and his absence from the West Saxon court can be linked with possible participation at Brunanburh and his later activity as a kind of kingmaker in York. It is also possible to trace a man's career at court through his position in the witness list, as in the case of Eadric Streona at the court of Æthelred 'the Unready' in the early 11th century.
Burdens that were due by landowners to the king, such as providing soldiers, resources and man-power, were sometimes relieved in charters. This gives historians the opportunity to examine aspects of Anglo-Saxon society."
Anglo-Saxon charters,Published charters,"A joint committee of the British Academy and the Royal Historical Society was set up in 1966 to oversee a definitive edition of the entire corpus of Anglo-Saxon charters. The edition is to be published in approximately thirty volumes. The late Professor Nicholas Brooks was chairman of the committee in charge; he has been replaced by Professor Simon Keynes.

William P. Yarborough,Early life,"William Pelham Yarborough was born May 12, 1912 in Seattle, Washington. He is the son of Colonel Leroy W. and Addessia Yarborough. He attended high school at San Rafael Military Academy in California and later at Columbus, Georgia. In 1931, Yarborough enlisted in the United States Army, obtaining an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy a year later in 1932. At his graduation from West Point in June 1936 Yarborough was sworn in as a second lieutenant by General of the Armies John Joseph Pershing. He was assigned to the 57th Infantry Regiment, Philippine Scouts at Fort McKinley, Luzon where he remained until February 1940, when he was transferred to the 29th Infantry Regiment at Fort Benning, Georgia. He volunteered for the airborne forces and joined the newly formed 501st Parachute Battalion in late 1940 and was given command of Company ""C"". Later, as Test Officer for the Provisional Parachute Group in 1941, he designed the paratrooper's boot, the paratrooper's uniform, the parachutist badge and airborne background trimming, and a number of aerial delivery containers for which he received U. S. patents.

Examples of the first parachutist badgeand first airborne background trimmingdesigned for the 501st Parachute Battalion,both created by William P. Yarborough.Yarborough first met his future wife, Norma Tuttle Yarborough (1918–1999), when she was 12 and he was 18. At the time, they were neighbors when their fathers were stationed at Fort Benning. They became reacquainted when the two families were next door neighbors at Plattsburgh Barracks in New York. The future Mrs. Yarborough studied under Karl Menninger at Washburn University when her father was assigned to Fort Leavenworth. In 1936 she was crowned ""Miss Topeka."""
William P. Yarborough,World War II,"In July 1942, seven months after the United States entered World War II, due to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Yarborough, now a major, was selected by Major General Mark W. Clark to be his Airborne Advisor and in that capacity accompanied him to England. As a working member of the London Planning Group, he developed the initial concept and plan for the airborne phase of the Allied invasion of North Africa, codenamed  Operation Torch. When the Paratroop Task Force departed Land's End, England on November 7, 1942, Yarborough, as executive officer (XO), accompanied it on its flight over Spain toward its target objectives in Algeria. This was the longest operational flight ever made by parachute troops. In the course of the ensuing action the airplane in which he was flying was shot down by Vichy French fighter aircraft over the Sebkra d'Oran. He participated in combat operations to capture Tafaroui Airdrome in Algeria. A week later, Yarborough parachuted into Youks les Bains Airfield near Tebessa, Algeria (near the Tunisian border) and fighting as part of a combined French and U.S. Paratroop Task Force in Tunisia until January 1943, when he returned to the United States.
In March 1943, Yarborough returned to North Africa as Commanding Officer (CO) of the 2nd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, under Colonel Reuben H. Tucker, itself part of the 82nd Airborne Division, commanded by Major General Matthew Ridgway. Yarborough, promoted to lieutenant colonel in May, led his battalion throughout the Allied invasion of Sicily, Operation Husky. Following a disastrous ambush by Italian forces at Tumminello Pass, Yarborough was relieved of his command by Major General Ridgway. Mark Clark, now a lieutenant general commanding the American Fifth Army, then had him assigned to his staff. During the Allied invasion of Italy in September Yarborough served as the airborne G-3 staff officer of the Fifth Army, and organized the night drop zone to receive the latest elements of the 82nd Airborne Division, which had flown from Sicily to relieve the beleaguered beachhead at Salerno.
Just prior to the fall of the Italian city and port of Naples, Yarborough was given command of the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion, whose CO, Major Doyle Yardley, had been captured. His unit, as part of Colonel William O. Darby's Ranger Force, made the initial landings at Anzio-Neptune in January 1944 and held a key position on the beachhead for the next two months. Later, after being relieved at Anzio, under his command the 509th, and two attached parachute battalions, spearheaded the Allied landings in southern France, landing on a mountaintop near Le Muy before dawn. Cannes, Nice and Monte Carlo along the Côte d'Azur fell to the parachutists who then turned northward into the Maritime Alps to protect the right flank of Lieutenant General Alexander Patch's U.S. Seventh Army as it moved north.
Yarborough returned briefly to the United States to attend the 21st course of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He returned to Italy in January 1945 as CO of the 473rd Regimental Combat Team, who had previously been antiaircraft gunners. The 473rd serving in the Italian Campaign, which, during Operation Grapeshot, fought its way up the Ligurian Coast to Genoa and the French border as World War II came to an end. It was during this campaign that he was awarded the Silver Star."
William P. Yarborough,"Service in Europe, US, and Cambodia","In June 1945 the 473d Infantry Regiment was deactivated and Yarborough, remaining in Europe, was named as Provost Marshal; first of the 15th Army Group, and later of the U.S. Forces in Austria and the Vienna Area Command. In the latter position he organized the famous Four Power International Patrol of Russian, French, British, and American military police.
From 1947 to 1949 Yarborough served as Director of the Department of Troop Information and Education at the Armed Forces Information School, Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. In 1950 he returned to Europe for the third time to attend the British Staff College at Camberley, England. Upon graduation he was assigned to the NATO Plans Section of the Joint American Military Advisory Group to Europe, stationed in London. He entered the Army War College as a student in 1952 and after graduation served on its faculty for three years.
In 1956 he became Deputy Chief of the U. S. Military Advisory and Assistance Group to Cambodia. He remained in this assignment until he returned to the U.S. Army War College for a temporary tour prior to assuming command of the 1st Battle Group, 7th Infantry at Fort Benning, Georgia, later moving it to Aschaffenburg, Germany. Leaving the Battle Group in 1958, he commanded the 66th Counterintelligence Corps Group in Stuttgart for two years until his reassignment to Fort Bragg, North Carolina."
William P. Yarborough,Commander of US Army Special Warfare Center,"In January 1961, he was appointed commander/commandant of the US Army Special Warfare Center/School for Special Warfare at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Remaining until 1965, he was instrumental in the build-up of Special Forces, overseeing the activation of four new Groups. He also worked diligently to increase the professional and academic standard of the JFK School, bringing in national figures in anthropology, history, science, and inviting leading political figures to speak. He initiated an exhaustive review of training programs and doctrine, and wrote numerous monographs on subjects pertaining to Special Operations, which are still relevant today. It was also under his management that foreign students were fully integrated into training and language instruction was expanded. He established five new courses including the Military Assistance Training Advisor School, the Unconventional Warfare course and the Counter-Terrorism course. He also initiated a staff study that later resulted in the movement of the US Army Civil Affairs School from Fort Gordon, Georgia to Fort Bragg.
It was during his tenure as Commander of the Special Warfare Center that in 1961, he arranged for President Kennedy to visit Fort Bragg, the results were twofold - acquiring the funding to further develop the Special Forces into a strategic unit within the US Army and the more visible sign - the authorization of the Green Beret for wear as the official headgear of Special Forces.  Yarborough's design for the original parachutists uniform was incorporated into the 1963 Army tropical uniform that was later worn by all Army units in the Vietnam War."
William P. Yarborough,Colombia,"A Fort Bragg top-level U.S. Special Warfare team, headed by Special Warfare Center commander Yarborough, visited Colombia in February 1962. In a secret supplement to his report to the joint Chiefs of Staff, Yarborough encouraged a stay-behind irregular force and its immediate deployment to eliminate communists representing a future threat:

[A] concerted country team effort should be made now to select civilian and military personnel for clandestine training in resistance operations in case they are needed later. This should be done with a view toward development of a civil and military structure for exploitation in the event the Colombian internal security system deteriorates further. This structure should be used to pressure toward reforms known to be needed, perform counter-agent and counter-propaganda functions and as necessary execute paramilitary, sabotage and/or terrorist activities against known communist proponents. It should be backed by the United States.
Yarborough encouraged ""an intensive civilian registration program ... so that [everyone] is eventually registered in government files together with fingerprints and photographs."" Interrogation procedures and techniques, including regular questioning of rural villagers ""who are believed to be knowledgeable of guerrilla activities"" were advised. ""Exhaustive interrogation of the bandits, to include sodium pentathol and polygraph, should be used to elicit every shred of information. Both the Army and the Police need trained interrogators."" Pentathol was originally used by doctors for relaxation, but in the 1970s it was reported used by some Latin American militaries to induce ""paralysis, agony, and terror.""""In general, the Yarborough team recommended that the US provide guidance and assistance in all aspects of counter-insurgency ... Civilian and military personnel, clandestinely selected and trained in resistance operations, would be required in order to develop an underground civil and military structure. This organization was to undertake 'clandestine execution of plans developed by the United States Government toward defined objectives in the political, economic, and military fields' ... it would ... undertake ... 'paramilitary, sabotage, and/or terrorist activities against known communist proponents'."" Yarborough did not feel that this would be successful unless it were under U.S. command."
William P. Yarborough,Asian service,"After his tenure at the Special Warfare School, he served as Senior Member, UN Command Military Armistice Commission, Panmunjom(1965.2.18~1965.10.5), Korea where he was the chief spokesman and negotiator for the UN Command in talks with the North Koreans and Chinese. He then was assigned as Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff for Special Operations in the Pentagon with the responsibility of all Special Forces, PSYOP and Civil Affairs units and activities. In this position, he completed exhaustive studies on the state of insurgencies in Thailand and Latin America. A year later, he became the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence on the Army General Staff where he monitored the Army's intelligence training programs, provided finished intelligence materials to the Army General Staff and directed the Army's personnel security program. He also directed the programs in which foreign military attaches assigned to Washington were involved and was responsible for their accreditation by DA.
During the final years of his career, Yarborough was the Army's top intelligence officer at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. He assumed the command of I Corps in Korea in 1968, a position he held for a year. I Corps consisted of both conventional and nuclear weapons, two American divisions and three Korean Divisions and a Korean Marine Corps Brigade, numbering approximately 100,000 men. In 1969, he was assigned as the Chief of Staff and Deputy Commander in Chief, U.S. Army Pacific, responsible for directing a wide variety of Army activities in the Pacific Rim, including planning joint training exercises, response to natural disasters and monitoring intelligence operations. He retired from the Army in 1971.In 1971, the Army tasked him to prepare a classified Asian study on the state of the Asian continent after the Vietnam War. He also was a guest speaker for the National Strategy Information Center where he gave talks such as the Changing Balance of Military Power or the history of Special Forces to various groups around the country. He also was asked to visit various countries such as Rhodesia and Mozambique for the State Department. From his visits, he wrote various talking papers still in use today."
William P. Yarborough,Later life,"Yarborough was a member of the Rotary and Kiwanis Clubs. He was also an honorary member of the British SAS Regiment and a member of the St. John's Lodge 260, F&AM. He wrote two books: Bail Out Over North Africa and So You Want A Volunteer Army. General Yarborough was married to his wife Norma for over 60 years. They had three children: 2 girls and one boy, LTC (Ret.) William Lee Yarborough, US Army. Mrs. Yarborough died in 1999.
Shortly before his death, Yarborough was honored on September 30, 2005 with the donation of a bust in his honor at the Airborne and Special Operations Museum in Fayetteville, North Carolina. In 2012, he and President John F. Kennedy were memorialized by a new statue at the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School at Fort Bragg. The statue was commissioned by Ross Perot.A veteran of four combat jumps, General Yarborough holds, among other awards and decorations, the Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star, Legion of Merit with three Oak Leaf Clusters, Bronze Star, Joint Services Commendation Medal, Italian Bronze Medal for Valor, Italian Cross for Valor, French Croix de Guerre with Palm, Regimental Badge 3d Zouaves, Korean Order of Merit Second Class, Combat Infantryman Badge, the Cambodian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Vietnamese Parachutist Badges, and the Unit Citation with Oak Leaf Cluster.
Lieutenant General William P. Yarborough was buried in Arlington National Cemetery SECTION 4  SITE 3099-D.
The Yarborough knife made by Chris Reeve Knives and in collaboration with William Harsey Jr., awarded to all Special Forces Qualification Course graduates, is named for him."

Château de Kaysersberg,History,"The castle was built for Albin Woelflin, imperial bailiff for Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, around 1220. The site was acquired in 1227 by the lords of Horbourg and Ribeaupierre. It had an important strategic role as it allowed the Empire to close off one of the routes across the Vosges Mountains towards Lorraine. The circular keep is the oldest part of the castle and one of the first of this type in the upper Rhine valley. It was designed at the same time as the keep at the Château de Pflixbourg. The first curtain wall, which included the keep, was replaced after 1261 by a wall enclosing the keep, according to a contemporary plan, which allowed an uninterrupted circuit of the walls and strengthened defences on the side likely to be attacked. 
In the 14th century, the castle was the residence of the imperial provost or bailiff. Following a fire, the enceinte was raised to 4 m. In the second half of the 15th century, the castle defences were modernised in response to developments in artillery and firearms; the crenels were closed with wooden shutters, the merlons were equipped with firing slits and the round walk was completely covered. In this period, the castle was merely a sub-bailliage and personnel were heavily reduced. During the German Peasants' War (1524/5), the castle was besieged. It was restored by Lazarre de Schwendi in 1583.
According to archaeological excavations and studies, the castle was abandoned at the end of the 16th century. After the French Revolution, it was declared a national asset and sold to François Joseph Boecklin de Boecklinsau, who planted vines, and later passed to the Bastard family."
Château de Kaysersberg,Description,"The castle is largely built from granite. It stands at an altitude of 295 m (approx. 975 ft) and dominates from 50m the north side of the town. The castle has a triangular plan dominated by the circular keep in the highest point. The keep is 11 m (36 ft) in diameter with walls 4.42 m (14+1⁄2 ft) thick. The original parapet has been kept to a height of 0.55 m, with the crenels and merlons restored. The spiral staircase is concrete. Access is to the first floor, through an arched doorway. The spacious third floor served as a storeroom and provided access to the platform which was originally covered. The keep had a purely military function. The main residential buildings were situated against the east curtain wall. On the other side, towards the town, was a large lower courtyard. The entrance to the castle, in the east, was by an arched doorway with a barbican; to the left is a cruciform cannon opening and a circular firing hole. The castle's enceinte is linked to the town's by curtain walls with a round walk.
The Château de Kaysersberg has been listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture since 1841."

Vaclav Smil,Early life and education,"Smil was born during World War II in Plzeň, at that time in the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (present-day Czech Republic). His father was a police officer and his mother a bookkeeper. Growing up in a remote mountain town in the Plzeň Region, Smil cut wood daily to keep the home heated. This provided an early lesson in energy efficiency and density.Smil completed his undergraduate studies and began his graduate work (culminating in the RNDr., an intermediate graduate degree similar to the Anglo-American Master of Philosophy credential, in 1965) at the Faculty of Natural Sciences of Charles University in Prague, where he took 35 classes a week, 10 months a year, for five years. ""They taught me nature, from geology to clouds,"" Smil said. After graduation he refused to join the Communist party, undermining his job prospects, though he found employment at a regional planning office. He married Eva, who was studying to be a physician. In 1969, following the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and Eva's graduation, the Smils emigrated to the United States, leaving the country months before a Soviet travel ban shut the borders. ""That was not a minor sacrifice, you know?"" Smil says. Smil then received his Ph.D. in geography from the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences of Pennsylvania State University in 1971."
Vaclav Smil,Career,"In 1972, Smil took his first job offer at the University of Manitoba where he remained for decades, until his retirement. He taught introductory environmental science courses among other subjects dealing with energy, atmospheric change, China, population and economic development."
Vaclav Smil,Position on energy,"Smil is skeptical that there will be a rapid transition to clean energy, believing it will take much longer than many predict. Smil said ""I have never been wrong on these major energy and environmental issues because I have nothing to sell,"" unlike many energy companies and politicians.Smil noted in 2018 that coal, oil, and natural gas still supply 90% of the world's primary energy. Despite decades of growth in newer renewable energy technologies, the worldwide proportion of energy supplied by fossil fuels had increased since 2000. He emphasizes that ""the greatest long-term challenge in the industrial sector will be to displace fossil carbon used in the production of primary iron, cement, ammonia and plastics"" which account for 15% of the total fossil fuel consumption globally. Smil favours reducing demand for fossil fuels through energy conservation, and calls for having the price of energy reflect its real costs including greenhouse gas emissions."
Vaclav Smil,Position on economic growth,"Smil believes economic growth has to end, that all growth is logistic rather than exponential, and that humans could consume much lower levels of materials and energy."
Vaclav Smil,Reception,"Included among Smil's admirers is Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who has read all of Smil's 36 books. ""I wait for new Smil books the way some people wait for the next Star Wars movie,"" Gates wrote in 2017. ""He's a slayer of bullshit,"" says David Keith, an energy and climate scientist at Harvard University."
Vaclav Smil,Personal life,"His wife Eva is a physician and his son David is an organic synthetic chemist.
He lives in a house with unusually thick insulation, grows some of his own food, and eats meat roughly once a week. He reads 60 to 110 non-technical books a year and keeps a list of all books he has read since 1969. He ""does not intend to have a cell phone ever.""Smil is known for being ""intensely private"", shunning the press while letting his books speak for themselves. At the University of Manitoba, he only ever showed up at one faculty meeting (since the 1980s). The school accepted his reclusiveness so long as he kept teaching and publishing highly rated books."
Vaclav Smil,Awards and honors,"He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (Science Academy) and the recipient of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Award for Public Understanding of Science and Technology in 2000. In 2010, he was named by Foreign Policy magazine to its list of FP Top 100 Global Thinkers. In 2013, he was appointed by the Governor General to the Order of Canada. In the fall of 2013, he was the EADS Distinguished Visitor at the American Academy in Berlin.
He has been an invited speaker in more than 300 conferences and workshops in the US, Canada, Europe, Asia and Africa, has lectured at many universities in North America, Europe and East Asia and has worked as a consultant for many US, European Union and international institutions.
His book How the World Really Works: The Science Behind How We Got Here and Where We're Going was a nominee for the 2022 Balsillie Prize for Public Policy."

Innti,Background,"Some prominent Gaelic poets in the generation prior to Innti were associated with the journal Comhar. Among these, who were of relevance to Innti were Seán Ó Ríordáin and the author of Nuabhéarsaíocht, Seán Ó Tuama. These writers were both from the County Cork area and Ó Ríordáin especially introduced European-styles into Irish-language poetry and themes of modern urban life. Ó Tuama held seminars on Irish poetry at University College Cork where Innti was founded in 1970.Aside from these local Irish influences, Innti was also influenced by the American-led counterculture of the 1960s which spread throughout the Western World. Among these foreign influences (principally from American poetry) were Beat poets such as Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac. Innti marked a counterpoint to the traditional Irish nationalist idealizatio of the Gaeltacht as a somewhat austere, rural Catholic bastion of a Pre-Colonial Ireland, counter-posed to ""English decadence"" in the cities. The Sexual Revolution, questioning of authority, a more cosmopolitan writing of Gaelicness and the arrival of pop music were innovations in Gaelic from Innti.The eclecticism of Innti, drawing from non-Gaelic sources, also allowed for Oriental-influences, such as the Tibetan Book of the Dead and Japanese haiku poetry, to feature alongside Anglophone and French modernist ones such as E. E. Cummings, T. S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens and Charles Baudelaire. This post-Christian environment even led to some, such as Rosenstock, exploring deeper Indo-European connections between Buddhism and pre-Christian Irish mythology and Gaelic culture."

Hakea longiflora,Description,Hakea longiflora is an upright shrub that typically grows to 0.6 to 0.75 metres (2 to 2 ft) high and forms a lignotuber. The evergreen compound-terete and rigid leaves have an undivided base that is 3 to 10 millimetres (0.118 to 0.394 in) in length and not grooved on lower surface. There are two or three ultimate segments with a length of 1 to 10 mm (0.039 to 0.394 in) and 0.8 to 1.5 mm (0.031 to 0.059 in) wide. It blooms from June to September and produces yellow flowers. Each simple inflorescence is composed of two flowers at different stages of development. It has a white perianth that is 6.5 to 12 mm (0.256 to 0.472 in) long and covered in matted hair. The smooth fruits that form later are covered in black blisters and have an obliquely narrowly ovate shape and a length of 18 to 25 mm (0.709 to 0.984 in) and a width of 6 to 7 mm (0.236 to 0.276 in) with a long beak. The seeds inside have a boomerang shape with a wing at the end and a length of 22 mm (0.866 in).
Hakea longiflora,Taxonomy,"The species was first formally described by the botanist Robyn Mary Barker in 1990 as part of the work New species, new combinations and other name changes in Hakea (Proteaceae) as published in the Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens. The only synonym is Hakea erinacea var. longiflora as described by George Bentham in 1870.The specific epithet is said to be derived from the Latin words longus meaning long and florus meaning ""flower"", referring to the long flowers of this plant compared to Hakea erinacea which Bentham thought this species was a variety of. The proper word for ""flower"" in classical and botanical Latin is however flos."
Hakea longiflora,Distribution,"It is endemic to an area between Dandaragan and Coorow in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia where it is found in and among breakaways growing in sandy-loamy-gravelly soils. It is usually in low open heath land communities often over sandstone. Although the species has a small range it is quite common within the area.

Analytical psychology,Origins,"Jung began his career as a psychiatrist in Zürich, Switzerland. Already employed at the Burghölzli hospital in 1901, in his academic dissertation for the medical faculty of the University of Zurich he took the risk of using his experiments on somnambulism and the visions of his mediumistic cousin, Helly Preiswerk. The work was entitled, ""On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena"". It was accepted but caused great upset among his mother's family. Under the direction of psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, he also conducted research with his colleagues using a galvanometer to evaluate the emotional sensitivities of patients to lists of words during word association. Jung has left a description of his use of the device in treatment. His research earned him a worldwide reputation and numerous honours, including honorary Doctorates from Clark and Fordham Universities in 1909 and 1910 respectively. Other honours followed later.Although they began corresponding a year earlier, in 1907 Jung travelled to meet Sigmund Freud in Vienna, Austria. At that stage, Jung, aged thirty-two, had a much greater international renown than the forty-nine-year-old neurologist. For a further six years, the two scholars worked and travelled to the United States together. In 1911, they founded the International Psychoanalytical Association, of which Jung was the first president. However, early in the collaboration, Jung had already observed that Freud would not tolerate ideas that were different from his own.Unlike most modern psychologists, Jung did not believe in restricting himself to the scientific method as a means to understanding the human psyche. He saw dreams, myths, coincidence, and folklore as empirical evidence to further understanding and meaning. So although the unconscious cannot be studied by using direct methods, it acts as a useful working hypothesis, according to Jung. As he said, ""The beauty about the unconscious is that it is really unconscious."" Hence, the unconscious is 'untouchable' by experimental researches, or indeed any possible kind of scientific or philosophical reach, precisely because it is unconscious."
Analytical psychology,The break with Freud,"It was the publication of a book by Jung which provoked the break with psychoanalysis and led to the founding of analytical psychology. In 1912 Jung met ""Miss Miller"", brought to his notice by the work of Théodore Flournoy and whose case gave further substance to his theory of the collective unconscious.: 213–215  The study of her visions supplied the material which would go on to furnish his reasoning which he developed in Psychology of the Unconscious (Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido) (re-published as Symbols of Transformation in 1952) (C.W. Vol. 5). At this, Freud muttered about ""heresy"". It was the second part of the work that brought the divergence to light. Freud mentioned to Ernest Jones that it was on page 174 of the original German edition, that Jung, according to him, had ""lost his way"".: 215  It is the extract where Jung enlarged on his conception of the libido. The sanction was immediate: Jung was officially banned from the Vienna psychoanalytic circle from August 1912. From that date the psychoanalytic movement split into two obediences, with Freud's partisans on one side, Karl Abraham being delegated to write a critical notice about Jung, and with Ernest Jones as defender of Freudian orthodoxy; while on the other side, were Jung's partisans, including Leonhard Seif, Franz Riklin, Johan van Ophuijsen and Alphonse Maeder.: 260 Jung's innovative ideas with a new formulation of psychology and lack of contrition sealed the end of the Jung-Freud friendship in 1913. From then, the two scholars worked independently on personality development: Jung had already termed his approach analytical psychology (1912), while the approach Freud had founded is referred to as the Psychoanalytic School, (psychoanalytische Schule).

Jung's postulated unconscious was quite different from the model proposed by Freud, despite the great influence that the founder of psychoanalysis had had on him. In particular, tensions manifested between him and Freud because of various disagreements, including those concerning the nature of the libido. Jung de-emphasized the importance of sexual development as an instinctual drive and focused on the collective unconscious: the part of the unconscious that contains memories and ideas which Jung believed were inherited from generations of ancestors. While he accepted that libido was an important source for personal growth, unlike Freud, Jung did not consider that libido alone was responsible for the formation of the core personality. Due to the particular hardships Jung had endured growing up, he believed his personal development and that of everyone was influenced by factors unrelated to sexuality.The overarching aim in life, according to Jungian psychology, is the fullest possible actualisation of the ""Self"" through individuation. Jung defines the ""self"" as ""not only the centre but also the whole circumference which embraces both conscious and unconscious; it is the centre of this totality, just as the ego is the centre of the conscious mind"". Central to this process of individuation is the individual's continual encounter with the elements of the psyche by bringing them into consciousness. People experience the unconscious through symbols encountered in all aspects of life: in dreams, art, religion, and the symbolic dramas enacted in relationships and life pursuits. Essential to the process is the merging of the individual's consciousness with the collective unconscious through a huge range of symbols. By bringing conscious awareness to bear on what is unconscious, such elements can be integrated with consciousness when they ""surface"". To proceed with the individuation process, individuals need to be open to the parts of themselves beyond their own ego, which is the ""organ"" of consciousness. In a famous dictum, Jung said, ""the Self, like the unconscious is an a priori existent out of which the ego evolves. It is ... an unconscious prefiguration of the ego. It is not I who create myself, rather I happen to myself'.It follows that the aim of (Jungian) psychotherapy is to assist the individual to establish a healthy relationship with the unconscious so that it is neither excessively out of balance in relation to it, as in neurosis, a state that can result in depression, anxiety, and personality disorders or so flooded by it that it risks psychosis resulting in mental breakdown. One method Jung applied to his patients between 1913 and 1916 was active imagination, a way of encouraging them to give themselves over to a form of meditation to release apparently random images from the mind to bridge unconscious contents into awareness.""Neurosis"" in Jung's view results from the build up of psychological defences the individual unconsciously musters in an effort to cope with perceived attacks from the outside world, a process he called a ""complex"", although complexes are not merely defensive in character. The psyche is a self-regulating adaptive system. People are energetic systems, and if the energy is blocked, the psyche becomes sick. If adaptation is thwarted, the psychic energy stops flowing and becomes rigid. This process manifests in neurosis and psychosis. Jung proposed that this occurs through maladaptation of one's internal realities to external ones. The principles of adaptation, projection, and compensation are central processes in Jung's view of psyche's attempts to adapt."
Analytical psychology,Innovations of Jungian analysis,
Analytical psychology,Philosophical and epistemological foundations,
Analytical psychology,Philosophy,"Jung was an adept principally of the American philosopher William James, founder of pragmatism, whom he met during his trip to the United States in 1909.: 255  He also encountered other figures associated with James, such as John Dewey and the anthropologist, Franz Boas.: 165  Pragmatism was Jung's favoured route to base his psychology on a sound scientific basis according to historian Sonu Shamdasani. His theories consist of observations of phenomena, and according to Jung it is phenomenology. In his view psychologism was suspect.Displacement into the conceptual deprives experience of its substance and the possibility of being simply named. Throughout his writings, Jung sees in empirical observation not only a precondition of an objective method but also respect for an ethical code which should guide the psychologist, as he stated in a letter to Joseph Goldbrunner: I consider it a moral obligation not to make assertions about things one cannot see or whose existence cannot be proved, and I consider it an abuse of epistemological power to do so regardless. These rules apply to all experimental science. Other rules apply to metaphysics. I regard myself as answerable to the rules of experimental science. As a result nowhere in my work are there any metaphysical assertions nor – nota bene – any negations of a metaphysical nature.
According to the Italo-French psychoanalyst Luigi Aurigemma, Jung's reasoning is also marked by Immanuel Kant, and more generally by German rationalist philosophy. His lectures are evidence of his assimilation of Kantian thought, especially the Critique of Pure Reason and Critique of Practical Reason. Aurigemma characterises Jung's thinking as ""epistemological relativism"" because it does not postulate any belief in the metaphysical.: 19  In fact, Jung uses Kant's teleology to bridle his thinking and to guard himself from straying into any metaphysical excursions.: 21  On the other hand, for French historian of psychology, Françoise Parot, contrary to the alleged rationalist vein, Jung is ""heir"" to mystics, (Meister Eckhart, Hildegard of Bingen, or Augustine of Hippo,: 96 ) and to the romantics be they scientists, such as Carl Gustav Carus or Gotthilf Heinrich von Schubert in particular, or to philosophers and writers, along the lines of Nietzsche, Goethe, and Schopenhauer, in the way he conceptualised the unconscious in particular. Whereas his typology is profoundly dependent on Carl Spitteler.: 255"
Analytical psychology,Scientific heritage,"As a trained psychiatrist, Jung had a grounding in the state of science in his day. He regularly refers to the experimental psychology of Wilhelm Wundt. His Word Association Test designed with Franz Riklin is actually the direct application of Wundt's theory. Notwithstanding the great debt of analytical psychology to Sigmund Freud, Jung borrowed concepts from other theories of his time. For instance, the expression ""abaissement du niveau mental"" comes directly from the French psychologist Pierre Janet whose courses Jung attended during his studies in France, during 1901. Jung had always acknowledged how much Janet had influenced his career. 

Jung's use of the concept of ""participation mystique"" is owed to the French ethnologist Lucien Lévy-Bruhl:What Rousseau describes is nothing other than the primitive collective mentality which Lucien Lévy-Bruhl has brilliantly called ""participation mystique"", which he uses to illustrate the surprising fact, to him, that some native peoples can experience relations that defy logic, as for instance in the case of the South American tribe, whom he met during his travels, where the men pretended they were scarlet aras birds. Finally, his use of the English expression, ""pattern of behaviour"", which is synonymous with the term archetype, is drawn from British studies in ethology.
The principal contribution to analytical psychology, nevertheless, remains that of Freud's psychoanalysis, from which Jung took a number of concepts, especially the method of inquiring into the unconscious through free association. Individual analysts' thinking was also integrated into his project, among whom are Sándor Ferenczi (Jung refers to his notion of ""affect"") or Ludwig Binswanger and his Daseinsanalyse , (Daseinsanalysis). Jung affirms also Freud's contribution to our knowledge of the psyche as being, without doubt, of the highest importance. It reveals penetrating information about the dark corners of the soul and of the human personality, which is of the same order as Nietzsche's On the Genealogy of Morality (1887). In this context, Freud was, according to Jung, one of the great cultural critics of the 19th century."
Analytical psychology,Divergences from psychoanalysis,"Jungian Analysis, as is psychoanalysis, is a method to access, experience and integrate unconscious material into awareness. It is a search for the meaning of behaviours, feelings and events. Many are the channels to extend knowledge of the self: the analysis of dreams is one important avenue. Others may include expressing feelings about and through art, poetry or other expressions of creativity, the examination of conflicts and repeating patterns in a person's life. A comprehensive description of the process of dream interpretation is complex, in that it is highly specific to the person who undertakes it. Most succinctly it relies on the associations which the particular dream symbols suggest to the dreamer, which at times may be deemed ""archetypal"" in so far as they are supposed common to many people throughout history. Examples could be a hero, an old man or woman, situations of pursuit, flying or falling.
Whereas (Freudian) psychoanalysis relies entirely on the development of the transference in the analysand (the person under treatment) to the analyst, Jung initially used the transference and later concentrated more on a dialectical and didactic approach to the symbolic and archetypal material presented by the patient. Moreover, his attitude towards patients departed from what he had observed in Freud's method. Anthony Stevens has explained it thus:

Though [Jung's] initial formulations arose mainly out of his own creative illness, they were also a conscious reaction against the stereotype of the classical Freudian analyst, sitting silent and aloof behind the couch, occasionally emitting ex cathedra pronouncements and interpretations, while remaining totally uninvolved in the patient's guilt, anguish, and need for reassurance and support. Instead, Jung offered the radical proposal that analysis is a dialectical procedure, a two-way exchange between two people, who are equally involved. Although it was a revolutionary idea when he first suggested it, it is a model which has influenced psychotherapists of most schools, though many seem not to realise that it originated with Jung.In place of Freud's ""surgical detachment"", Jung demonstrated a more relaxed and warmer welcome in the consulting room. He remained aware nonetheless that exposure to a patient's unconscious contents always posed a certain risk of contagion (he calls it ""psychic infection"") to the analyst, as experienced in the countertransference. The process of contemporary Jungian analysis depends on the type of ""school of analytical psychology"" to which the therapist adheres, (see below). The ""Zurich School"" would reflect the approach Jung himself taught, while those influenced by Michael Fordham and associates in London, would be significantly closer to a Kleinian approach and therefore, concerned with analysis of the transference and countertransference as indicators of repressed material along with the attendant symbols and patterns."
Analytical psychology,Dream work,"Jung's preoccupation with dreams can be dated from 1902. It was only after the break with Freud that he published in 1916 his ""Psychology of the Unconscious"" where he elaborated his view of dreams, which contrasts sharply with Freud's conceptualisation. While he agrees that dreams are a highway into the unconscious, he enlarges on their functions further than psychoanalysis did. One of the salient differences is the compensatory function they perform by reinstating psychic equilibrium in respect of judgments made during waking life: thus a man consumed by ambition and arrogance may, for example, dream about himself as small and vulnerable person.
According to Jung, this demonstrates that the man's attitude is excessively self-assured and thereby refuses to integrate the inferior aspects of his personality, which are denied by his defensive arrogance. Jung calls this a compensation mechanism, necessary for the maintenance of a healthy mental balance. Shortly before his death in 1961, he wrote:To secure mental and even physiological stability, it is necessary that the conscious and unconscious should be integrated one with the other. This is so that they evolve in parallel. (Pour sauvegarder la stabilité mentale, et même physiologique, il faut que la conscience et l'inconscient soient intégralement reliés, afin d'évoluer parallèlement) Unconscious material is expressed in images through the deployment of symbolism which, in Jungian terms, means it has an affective role (in that it can sometimes give rise to a numinous feeling, when associated with an archetypal force) and an intellectual role. Some dreams are personal to the dreamer, others may be collective in origin or ""transpersonal"" in so far as they relate to existential events. They can be taken to express phases of the individuation process (see below) and may be inspired by literature, art, alchemy or mythology.
Analytical psychology is recognized for its historical and geographical study of myths as a means to deconstruct, with the aid of symbols, the unconscious manifestations of the psyche. Myths are said to represent directly the elements and phenomena arising from the collective unconscious and though they may be subject to alteration in their detail through time, their significance remains similar. While Jung relies predominantly on Christian or on Western pagan mythology (Ancient Greece and Rome), he holds that the unconscious is driven by mythologies derived from all cultures. He evinced an interest in Hinduism, in Zoroastrianism and Taoism, which all share fundamental images reflected in the psyche. Thus analytical psychology focusses on meaning, based on the hypothesis that human beings are potentially in constant touch with universal and symbolic aspects common to humankind. In the words of André Nataf: Jung opens psychoanalysis to a dimension currently obscured by the prevailing scientism: spirituality. His contribution, though questionable in certain respects, remains unique. His explorations of the unconscious carried out both as a scientist and a poet, indicate that it is structured as a language but one which is in a mythical mode. (Jung ouvre la psychanalyse à une dimension cachée par le scientisme ambiant : la spiritualité. Son apport, quoique contestable sur certains points, reste unique. Explorant l'inconscient en scientifique et poète, il montre que celui-ci se structure non-comme une langue mais sur le mode du mythe)"
Analytical psychology,Principal concepts,"In analytical psychology two distinct types of psychological process may be identified: that deriving from the individual, characterised as ""personal"", belonging to a subjective psyche, and that deriving from the collective, linked to the structure of an objective psyche, which may be termed ""transpersonal"". These processes are both said to be archetypal. Some of these processes are regarded as specifically linked to consciousness, such as the animus or anima, the persona or the shadow. Others pertain more to the collective sphere. Jung tended to personify the anima and animus as they are, according to him, always attached to a person and represent an aspect of his or her psyche."
Analytical psychology,Anima and animus,"Jung identified the archetypal anima as being the unconscious feminine component of men and the archetypal animus as the unconscious masculine component in women. These are shaped by the contents of the collective unconscious, by others, and by the larger society. However, many modern-day Jungian practitioners do not ascribe to a literal definition, citing that the Jungian concept points to every person having both an anima and an animus. Jung considered, for instance, an ""animus of the anima"" in men, in his work Aion and in an interview in which he says:Yes, if a man realizes the animus of his anima, then the animus is a substitute for the old wise man. You see, his ego is in relation to the unconscious, and the unconscious is personified by a female figure, the anima. But in the unconscious is also a masculine figure, the wise old man. And that figure is in connection with the anima as her animus, because she is a woman. So, one could say the wise old man was in exactly the same position as the animus to a woman.Jung stated that the anima and animus act as guides to the unconscious unified Self, and that forming an awareness and a connection with the anima or animus is one of the most difficult and rewarding steps in psychological growth. Jung reported that he identified his anima as she spoke to him, as an inner voice, unexpectedly one day.
In cases where the anima or animus complexes are ignored, they vie for attention by projecting itself on others. This explains, according to Jung, why we are sometimes immediately attracted to certain strangers: we see our anima or animus in them. Love at first sight is an example of anima and animus projection. Moreover, people who strongly identify with their gender role (e.g. a man who acts aggressively and never cries) have not actively recognized or engaged their anima or animus.
Jung attributes human rational thought to be the male nature, while the irrational aspect is considered to be natural female (rational being defined as involving judgment, irrational being defined as involving perceptions). Consequently, irrational moods are the progenies of the male anima shadow and irrational opinions of the female animus shadow."
Analytical psychology,Archetypes,"The use of archetypes in psychology was advanced by Jung in an essay entitled ""Instinct and the Unconscious"" in 1919. The first element in Greek 'arche' signifies 'beginning, origin, cause, primal source principle', by extension it can signify 'position of a leader, supreme rule and government'. The second element 'type' means 'blow or what is produced by a blow, the imprint of a coin ...form, image, prototype, model, order, and norm', ...in the figurative, modern sense, 'pattern underlying form, primordial form'. In his psychological framework, archetypes are innate, universal or personal prototypes for ideas and may be used to interpret observations. The method he favoured was hermeneutics which was central in his practice of psychology from the start. He made explicit references to hermeneutics in the Collected Works and during his theoretical development of the notion of archetypes. Although he lacks consistency in his formulations, his theoretical development of archetypes is rich in hermeneutic implications. As noted by Smythe and Baydala (2012), his notion of the archetype as such can be understood hermeneutically as a form of non-conceptual background understanding. A group of memories and attitudes associated with an archetype can become a complex, e.g. a mother complex may be associated with a particular mother archetype. Jung treated the archetypes as psychological organs, analogous to physical ones in that both are morphological givens which probably arose through evolution.
Archetypes have been regarded as collective as well as individual, and identifiable in a variety of creative ways. As an example, in his book Memories, Dreams, Reflections, Jung states that he began to see and talk to a manifestation of anima and that she taught him how to interpret dreams. As soon as he could interpret on his own, Jung said that she ceased talking to him because she was no longer needed. However, the essentialism inherent in archetypal theory in general and concerning the anima, in particular, has called for a re‐evaluation of Jung's theory in terms of emergence theory. This would emphasise the role of symbols in the construction of affect in the midst of collective human action. In such a reconfiguration, the visceral energy of a numinous experience can be retained while the problematic theory of archetypes has outlived its usefulness."
Analytical psychology,Collective unconscious,"Jung's concept of the collective unconscious has undergone re-interpretation over time. The term ""collective unconscious"" first appeared in Jung's 1916 essay, ""The Structure of the Unconscious"". This essay distinguishes between the ""personal"", Freudian unconscious, filled with fantasies (e. g. sexual) and repressed images, and the ""collective"" unconscious encompassing the soul of humanity at large.
In ""The Significance of Constitution and Heredity in Psychology"" (November 1929), Jung wrote:And the essential thing, psychologically, is that in dreams, fantasies, and other exceptional states of mind the most far-fetched mythological motifs and symbols can appear autochthonously at any time, often, apparently, as the result of particular influences, traditions, and excitations working on the individual, but more often without any sign of them. These ""primordial images"" or ""archetypes,"" as I have called them, belong to the basic stock of the unconscious psyche and cannot be explained as personal acquisitions. Together they make up that psychic stratum which has been called the collective unconscious.
The existence of the collective unconscious means that individual consciousness is anything but a tabula rasa and is not immune to predetermining influences. On the contrary, it is in the highest degree influenced by inherited presuppositions, quite apart from the unavoidable influences exerted upon it by the environment. The collective unconscious comprises in itself the psychic life of our ancestors right back to the earliest beginnings. It is the matrix of all conscious psychic occurrences, and hence it exerts an influence that compromises the freedom of consciousness in the highest degree, since it is continually striving to lead all conscious processes back into the old paths.
Given that in his day he lacked the advances of complexity theory and especially complex adaptive systems (CAS), it has been argued that his vision of archetypes as a stratum in the collective unconscious, corresponds to nodal patterns in the collective unconscious which go on to shape the characteristic patterns of human imagination and experience and in that sense, ""seems a remarkable, intuitive articulation of the CAS model""."
Analytical psychology,Individuation,"Individuation is a complex process that involves going through different stages of growing awareness through the progressive confrontation and integration of personal unconscious elements. This is the central concept of analytical psychology first introduced in 1916. It is the objective of Jungian psychotherapy to the extent that it enables the realisation of the Self. As Jung stated: The aim of individuation is nothing less than to divest the self of the false wrappings of the persona, on the one hand and the suggestive power of primordial images on the other.  Jung started experimenting with individuation after his split with Freud as he confronted what was described as eruptions from the collective unconscious driven by a contemporary malaise of spiritual alienation. According to Jung, individuation means becoming an individual and implies becoming one's own self. Unlike individuality, which emphasizes some supposed peculiarity, Jung described individuation as a better and more complete fulfillment of the collective qualities of the human being. In his experience, Jung explained that individuation helped him, ""from the therapeutic point of view, to find the particular images that lie behind emotions"".Individuation is from the first what the analys and must undergo, to integrate the other elements of the psyche.: 35  This pursuit of wholeness aims to establish the Self, which include both the rational conscious mind of the ego and the irrational contents of the unconscious, as the new personality center. Prior to individuation, the analysand is carefully assessed to determine if the ego is strong enough to take the intensity of this process. The elements to be integrated include the persona which acts as the representative of the person in her/his role in society, the shadow which contains all that is personally unknown and what the person considers morally reprehensible and, the anima or the animus, which respectively carry their feminine and masculine values. For Jung many unconscious conflicts at the root of neurosis are caused by the difficulty to accept that such a dynamic can unbalance the subject from his habitual position and confronts her/him with aspects of the self they were accustomed to ignore. Once individuation is completed the ego is no longer at the centre of the personality. The process, however, does not lead to a complete self-realization and that individuation can never be a fixed state due to the unfathomable nature of the depths of the collective unconscious."
Analytical psychology,Shadow,"The shadow is an unconscious complex defined as the repressed, suppressed or disowned qualities of the conscious self. According to Jung, the human being deals with the reality of the shadow in four ways: denial, projection, integration and/or transmutation. Jung himself asserted that ""the result of the Freudian method of elucidation is a minute elaboration of man's shadow-side unexampled in any previous age."": 63  According to analytical psychology, a person's shadow may have both constructive and destructive aspects. In its more destructive aspects, the shadow can represent those things people do not accept about themselves. For instance, the shadow of someone who identifies as being kind may be harsh or unkind. Conversely, the shadow of a person who perceives himself to be brutal may be gentle. In its more constructive aspects, a person's shadow may represent hidden positive qualities. This has been referred to as the ""gold in the shadow"". Jung emphasized the importance of being aware of shadow material and incorporating it into conscious awareness to avoid projecting shadow qualities on others.
The shadow in dreams is often represented by dark figures of the same gender as the dreamer.The shadow may also concern great figures in the history of human thought or even spiritual masters, who became great because of their shadows or because of their ability to live their shadows (namely, their unconscious faults) in full without repressing them."
Analytical psychology,Persona,"Just like the anima and animus, the persona (derived from the Latin term for a mask, as would have been worn by actors) is another key concept in analytical psychology. It is the part of the personality which manages an individual's relations with society in the outside world and works the same way for both sexes. The persona ... is the individual's system of adaptation to, or the manner assumed in dealing with the world. Every calling or profession, for example, has its own characteristic persona [...] Only the danger is that (people) become identical with their personas: thus the professor with his textbook, the tenor with his voice. One could say with little exaggeration, that the persona is that which in reality one is not, but which oneself as well as others think one is.: 415–416  The persona, which is at the heart of the psyche, is contrary to the shadow which is actually the true personality but denied by the self. The conscious self identifies primarily with the persona during development in childhood as the individual develops a psychological framework for dealing with others. Identifications with diplomas, social roles, with honours and awards, with a career, all contribute to the apparent constitution of the persona and which do not lead to knowledge of the self. For Jung, the persona has nothing real about it. It can only be a compromise between the individual and society, yielding an illusion of individuality. Individuation consists, in the first instance, of discarding the individual's mask, but not too quickly as often, it is all the patient has as a means of identification. The persona is implicated in a number of symptoms such as compulsive disorders, phobias, shifting moods, and addictions, among others."
Analytical psychology,Psychological types,"Analytical psychology distinguishes several psychological types or temperaments.

Extravert
IntrovertAccording to Jung, the psyche is an apparatus for adaptation and orientation, and consists of a number of different psychic functions. Among these he distinguishes four basic functions:
Sensation – Perception by means of the sense organs
Intuition – Perceiving in unconscious way or perception of unconscious contents
Thinking – Function of intellectual cognition; the forming of logical conclusions
Feeling – Function of subjective estimationThinking and feeling functions are rational, while the sensation and intuition functions are irrational.
Note: There is ambiguity in the term 'rational' that Carl Jung ascribed to the thinking/feeling functions. Both thinking and feeling irrespective of orientation (i.e., introverted/extroverted) employ/utilize/are directed by in loose terminology an underlying 'logical' IF-THEN construct/process (as in IF X THEN Y) in order to form judgments. This underlying construct/process is not directly observable in normal states of consciousness especially when engaged in thoughts/feelings. It can be cognized merely as a concept/abstraction during thoughtful reflection. Sensation and intuition are 'irrational' functions simply because they do not employ the above-mentioned underlying logical construct/process."
Analytical psychology,Complexes,"Early in Jung's career he coined the term and described the concept of the ""complex"". Jung claims to have discovered the concept during his free association and galvanic skin response experiments. Freud obviously took up this concept in his Oedipus complex amongst others. Jung seemed to see complexes as quite autonomous parts of psychological life. It is almost as if Jung were describing separate personalities within what is considered a single individual, but to equate Jung's use of complexes with something along the lines of multiple personality disorder would be a step out of bounds.
Jung saw an archetype as always being the central organizing structure of a complex. For instance, in a ""negative mother complex"", the archetype of the ""negative mother"" would be seen to be central to the identity of that complex. This is to say, our psychological lives are patterned on common human experiences. Jung saw the Ego (which Freud wrote about in German literally as the ""I"", one's conscious experience of oneself) as a complex. If the ""I"" is a complex, what might be the archetype that structures it? Jung, and many Jungians, might say ""the hero"", one who separates from the community to ultimately carry the community further."
Analytical psychology,Synchronicity,"Jung first officially used the term synchronicity during a conference held in memory of his sinologist friend, Richard Wilhelm in 1930. It was part of his explanation of the modus operandi of the I Ching. The second reference was made in 1935 in his Tavistock Lectures.

For an overview of the origins of the concept, see Joseph Cambray: ""Synchronicity as emergence"". It was used to denote the simultaneous occurrence of two events with no causal physical connection, but whose association evokes a meaning for the person experiencing or observing it. The often cited example of the phenomenon is Jung's own account of a beetle (the common rose-chafer, Cetonia aurata) flying into his consulting room directly following on from his patient telling him a dream featuring a golden scarab. The concept only makes sense psychologically and cannot be reduced to a verified or scientific fact. For Jung it constitutes a working hypothesis which has subsequently given rise to many ambiguities.I chose this term because the simultaneous occurrence of two meaningfully but not causally connected events seemed to me an essential criterion. I am therefore using the general concept of synchronicity in the special sense of a coincidence in time of two or more causally unrelated events which have the same or a similar meaning, in contrast to synchronism, which simply means the simultaneous occurrence of two events.
Synchronicity therefore means the simultaneous occurrence of a certain psychic state with one or more external events which appear as meaningful parallels to the momentary subjective state -and, in certain cases, vice versa. 
According to Jung, an archetype which has been constellated in the psyche can, under certain circumstances, transgress the boundary between substance and psyche. 

Jung had studied such phenomena with the physicist and Nobel Prize winner, Wolfgang Pauli, who did not always agree with Jung, and with whom he carried on an extensive correspondence, enriched by the contributions of both specialists in their own fields. Pauli had given a series of lectures to the C. G. Jung Institute, Zürich whose member and patron he had been since 1947. It gave rise to a joint essay: Synchronicity, an a-causal principle (1952) The two men saw in the idea of synchronicity a potential way of explaining a particular relationship between ""incontrovertible facts"", whose occurrence is tied to unconscious and archetypal manifestations, The psyche and matter are ordered according to principles which are common, neutral, and incontrovertible. Borrowing the notion from Arthur Schopenhauer, Jung calls it Unus mundus, a state where neither matter nor the psyche are distinguishable. whereas for Pauli it was a limiting concept, in two senses, in that it is at once scientific and symbolic. According to him, the phenomenon is dependent on the observer. Nevertheless, both men were in accord that there existed the possibility of a conjunction between physics and psychology. Jung wrote in a letter to Pauli:These researches (Jung's research into alchemy), have shown me that modern physics can symbolically represent psychological processes down to the minutest detail.
Marie-Louise von Franz also had a lengthy exchange of letters with Wolfgang Pauli. On Pauli's death in 1958, his widow, Franca, deliberately destroyed all the letters von Franz had sent to her husband, and which he had kept locked inside his writing desk. However, the letters from Pauli to von Franz were all saved and were later made available to researchers and published.Synchronicity is among the most developed ideas by Jung's followers, notably by Michel Cazenave , James Hillman, Roderick Main, Carl Alfred Meier and by the British developmental clinician, George Bright. It has been explored also in a range of spiritual currents who have sought in it a scientific rigour.Although Synchronicity as conceived by Jung within the bounds of the science available in his day, has been categorised as pseudoscience, recent developments in complex adaptive systems argue for a revision of such a view. Critics cite that Jung's experiments that sought to provide statistical proof for this theory did not yield satisfactory result. His experiment was also faulted for not using a true random sampling method as well as for the use of dubious statistics and astrological material."
Analytical psychology,Post-Jungian approaches,"Andrew Samuels (1985) has distinguished three distinct traditions or approaches of ""post-Jungian"" psychology – classical, developmental and archetypal. Today there are more developments."
Analytical psychology,Classical,"The classical approach tries to remain faithful to Jung's proposed model, his teachings and the substance of his 20 volume Collected Works, together with recently published works, such as the Liber Novus, and the Black Books. Prominent advocates of this approach, according to Samuels (1985), include Emma Jung, Jung's wife, an analyst in her own right, Marie-Louise von Franz, Joseph L. Henderson, Aniela Jaffé, Erich Neumann, Gerhard Adler and Jolande Jacobi. Jung credited Neumann, author of ""Origins of Conscious"" and ""Origins of the Child"", as his principal student to advance his (Jung's) theory into a mythology-based approach. He is associated with developing the symbolism and archetypal significance of several myths: the Child, Creation, the Hero, the Great Mother and Transcendence."
Analytical psychology,Archetypal,"One archetypal approach, sometimes called ""the imaginal school"" by James Hillman, was written about by him in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Its adherents, according to Samuels (1985), include Gerhard Adler, Irene Claremont de Castillejo, Adolf Guggenbühl-Craig, Murray Stein, Rafael López-Pedraza  and Wolfgang Giegerich. Thomas Moore also was influenced by some of Hillman's work. Developed independently, other psychoanalysts have created strong approaches to archetypal psychology. Mythopoeticists and psychoanalysts such as Clarissa Pinkola Estés who believes that ethnic and aboriginal people are the originators of archetypal psychology and have long carried the maps for the journey of the soul in their songs, tales, dream-telling, art and rituals; Marion Woodman who proposes a feminist viewpoint regarding archetypal psychology. Some of the mythopoetic/archetypal psychology creators either imagine the Self not to be the main archetype of the collective unconscious as Jung thought, but rather assign each archetype equal value. Others, who are modern progenitors of archetypal psychology (such as Estés), think of the Self as the thing that contains and yet is suffused by all other archetypes, each giving life to the other.
Robert L. Moore has explored the archetypal level of the human psyche in a series of five books co-authored with Douglas Gillette, which have played an important role in the men's movement in the United States. Moore studies computerese so he uses a computer's hard wiring (its fixed physical components) as a metaphor for the archetypal level of the human psyche. Personal experiences influence the access to the archetypal level of the human psyche, but personalized ego consciousness can be likened to computer software."
Analytical psychology,Developmental,"A major expansion of Jungian theory is credited to Michael Fordham and his wife, Frieda Fordham. It can be considered a bridge between traditional Jungian analysis and Melanie Klein's object relations theory. Judith Hubback and William Goodheart MD are also included in this group. Andrew Samuels (1985) considers J.W.T. Redfearn, Richard Carvalho and himself as representatives of the developmental approach. Samuels notes how this approach differs from the classical by giving less emphasis to the Self and more emphasis to the development of personality; he also notes how, in terms of practice in therapy, it gives more attention to transference and counter-transference than either the classical or the archetypal approaches."
Analytical psychology,Sandplay therapy,"Sandplay is a non-directive, creative form of therapy using the imagination, originally used with children and adolescents, later also with adults. Jung had stressed the importance of finding the image behind the emotion. The use of sand in a suitable tray with figurines and other small toys, farm animals, trees, fences and cars enables a narrative to develop through a series of scenarios. This is said to express an ongoing dialogue between the conscious and the unconscious aspects of the psyche, which in turn activates a healing process whereby the patient and therapist can together view the evolving sense of self.Jungian Sandplay started as a therapeutic method in the 1950s. Although its origin has been credited to a Swiss Jungian analyst, Dora Kalff it was in fact, her mentor and trainer, Dr. Margaret Lowenfeld, a British paediatrician, who had developed the Lowenfeld World Technique inspired by the writer H. G. Wells in her work with children, using a sand tray and figurines in the 1930s. Jung had witnessed a demonstration of the technique while on a visit to the UK in 1937. Kalff saw in it potential as a further application of analytical psychology. Encouraged by Jung, Kalff developed the new application over a number of years and called it Sandplay. From 1962 she began to train Jungian Analysts in the method including in the United States, Europe and Japan. Both Kalff and Jung believed an image can offer greater therapeutic engagement and insight than words alone. Through the sensory experience of working with sand and objects, and their symbolic resonance new areas of awareness can be brought into consciousness, as in dreams, which through their frames and storyline can bring material into consciousness as part of an integrating and healing process. The historian of psychology, Sonu Shamdasani has commented:

Historical reflection suggests the spirit of Jung's practice of the image, his engagement with his own figures, is indeed more alive in Sandplay than in other Jungian conclaves.
One of Dora Kalff's trainees was the American concert pianist, Joel Ryce-Menuhin, whose music career was ended by illness and who retrained as a Jungian analyst and exponent of sandplay."
Analytical psychology,Process-oriented psychology,"Process-oriented psychology (also called Process work) is associated with the Zurich-trained Jungian analyst Arnold Mindell. Process work developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s and was originally identified as a ""daughter of Jungian psychology"". Process work stresses awareness of the ""unconscious"" as an ongoing flow of experience. This approach expands Jung's work beyond verbal individual therapy to include body experience, altered and comatose states as well as multicultural group work."
Analytical psychology,The Analytic attitude,"Formally Jungian analysis differs little from psychoanalysis. However, variants of each school have developed overlaps and specific divergences through the century, or more, of their existence. They share a ""frame"" consisting of regular spatio-temporal meetings, one or more times a week, focusing on patient material, using dialogue which may consist of elaboration, amplification and abreaction and which may last on average three years (sometimes more briefly or far longer). The spatial arrangement between analyst and analysand may differ: seated face to face or the patient may use the couch with the analyst seated behind.In some approaches alternative elements of expression can take place, such as active imagination, sandplay, drawing or painting, even music. The session may at times become semi-directed (in contrast to psychoanalytic treatment which is essentially a non-directive encounter).: 738  The patient is at the heart of the therapy, as Marie Louise von Franz has it in her work, ""Psychotherapy: the practitioner's experience"", where she recounts Jung's thinking on that point. The transference is sought out (contrary to psychoanalytic treatment which distinguishes positive and negative transferences) and, the interpretation of dreams is one of the central pillars of Jungian psychotherapy. In all other respects, the rules correspond to those of classical psychoanalysis: the analyst examines free associations and tries to be objective and ethical, meaning respectful of the patient's pace and rhythm of unfolding progress. In fact, the task of Jungian analysis is not merely to explore the patient's past, but to connect conscious awareness with the unconscious such that a better adaptation to their emotional and social life may ensue.

Neurosis is not a symptom of the re-emergence of a repressed past, but is regarded as the functional, sometimes somatic, incapacity to face certain aspects of lived reality. In Jungian analysis the unconscious is the motivator whose task it is to bring into awareness the patient's shadow, in alliance with the analyst, the more so since unconscious processes enacted in the transference provoke a dependent relationship by the analysand on the analyst, leading to a falling away of the usual defences and references. This requires that the analyst guarantee the safety of the transference. The responsibilities and accountability of individual analysts and their membership organisations, matters of clinical confidentiality and codes of ethics and professional relations with the public sphere are explored in a volume edited by Solomon and Twyman, with contributions from Jungian analysts and psychoanalysts. Solomon has characterised the nature of the patient – analyst relationship as one where the analytic attitude is an ethical attitude since: The ethical attitude presupposes special responsibilities that we choose to adopt in relation to another. Thus, a parallel situation pertains between caregiver and child and between analyst and patient: they are not equal partners, but nevertheless are in a situation of mutuality, shared subjectivity, and reciprocal influence."
Analytical psychology,"Jungian social, literary and art criticism","Analytical psychology has inspired a number of contemporary academic researchers to revisit some of Jung's own preoccupations with the role of women in society, with philosophy and with literary and art criticism. Leading figures to explore these fields include the British-American, Susan Rowland, who produced the first feminist revision of Jung and the fundamental contributions made to his work by the creative women who surrounded him. She has continued to mine his work by evaluating his influence on modern literary criticism and as a writer. Leslie Gardner has devoted a series of volumes to analytical psychology in 21st century life, one of which concentrates on the ""Feminine Self"". Paul Bishop, a British German scholar, has placed analytical psychology in the context of precursors such as, Goethe, Schiller and Nietzsche.The Franco-Swiss art historian and analytical psychologist, Christian Gaillard, has examined Jung's place as an artist and art critic in his series of Fay lectures at the Texas A&M University. These scholars draw from Jung's works that apply analytical psychology to literature such as the lecture ""On the Relation of Analytical Psychology to Poetry"". In this presentation, which was delivered in 1922, Jung stated that the psychologist cannot replace the art critic. He rejected the Freudian art criticism for reducing complex works of art to Oedipal fantasies of their creators, stressing the danger of simplifying literature to causes found outside of the actual work."
Analytical psychology,Criticism,"Since its inception, analytical psychology has been the object of criticism, emanating from the psychoanalytic sphere. Freud himself characterised Jung as a ""mystic and a snob"". In his introduction to the 2011 edition of Jung's ""Lectures on the Theory of Psychoanalysis"", given in New York City in 1912, Sonu Shamdasani contends that Freud orchestrated a round of critical reviews of Jung's writings from Karl Abraham, Jung's former colleague at the Burghölzli hospital, and from the early Welsh Freudian, Ernest Jones. Such criticisms multiplied during the 20th century, focusing primarily on the ""mysticism"" in Jung's writings. Other psychoanalysts, including Jungian analysts, objected to the cult of personality around the Swiss psychiatrist. It reached a crescendo with Jung's perceived collusion with Nazism in the build-up and during World War II and is still a recurrent theme. Thomas Kirsch writes: ""Successive generations of Jungian analysts and analysands have wrestled with the question of Jung's complex relations to Germany."" Other considered evaluations come from Andrew Samuels and from Robert Withers.

The French philosopher, Yvon Brès , considers that the concept of the collective unconscious, ""shows also how easily one can slip from the psychological unconscious into perspectives from a universe of thought, quite alien from traditional philosophy and science, where this idea arose."" (""Le concept jungien d'inconscient collectif ""témoigne également de la facilité avec laquelle on peut glisser du concept d'inconscient psychologique vers des perspectives relevant d'un univers de pensée étranger à la tradition philosophique et scientifique dans laquelle ce concept est né'"").In his Le Livre Rouge de la psychanalyse (""Red Book of psychoanalysis""), the French psychoanalyst, Alain Amselek , criticizes Jung's tendency to be fascinated by the image and to reduce the human to an archetype. He contends that Jung dwells in a world of ideas and abstractions, in a world of books and old secrets lost in ancient books of spells (fr: grimoires). While claiming to be an empiricist, Amselek finds Jung to be an idealist, a pure thinker who has unquestionably demonstrated his intellectual talent for speculation and the invention of ideas. While he considers his epistemology to be in advance of that of Freud, Jung remains stuck in his intellectualism and in his narrow provincial outlook. In fact, his hypotheses are determined by the concept of his postulated pre-existing world and he has constantly sought to find confirmations of it in the old traditions of Western Medieval Europe.More problematic has been, at times, the ad hominem criticism of academics outside the field of analytical psychology. One, a Catholic historian of psychiatry, Richard Noll, wrote three volumes but was able to publish only the first two in 1994 and 1997. Nolls argued that analytical psychology is based on a neo-pagan Hellenistic cult. These attacks on Jung and his work prompted the French psychoanalyst, Élisabeth Roudinesco, to state in a review: ""Even if Noll's theses are based on a solid familiarity with the Jungian corpus [...], they deserve to be re-examined, such is the detestation of the author for the object of his study that it diminishes the credibility of the arguments."" (""Même si les thèses de Noll sont étayées par une solide connaissance du corpus jungien [...], elles méritent être réexaminées, tant la détestation de l'auteur vis-à-vis de son objet d'étude diminue la crédibilité de l'argumentation."") Another, a French ethnographer and anthropologist, Jean-Loïc Le Quellec , criticized Jung over his alleged misuse of the term archetype and his ""suspect motives"" in dealings with some of his colleagues."

Nick Albertson,Themes,"Primarily utilizing a Toyo-Field 45CF 4-by-5 camera, Nick Albertson's  work combines photography, video, and sculptural forms. Albertson's recent body of work utilizes the repetitive patterning of everyday household items such as rubber bands, cups, straws, paper napkins, and plastic bags. When framed through Nick Albertson's photographic lens, these mundane objects undergo a transformation. Through patterning, light and shadow, sculptural formations, and post-production editing, Albertson's work blurs the lines between abstraction and representation, playing to the repetitive nature of the objects in question and the viewer's familiarity with common household products. ""In my work, I strip utilitarian objects of their functions, repurposing them to create visceral experiences."" One reviewer noted that in some of Albertson's works, it is obvious to tell which household or office item he is utilizing in his works. Others, not so much. The repeated motif leads towards abstraction in a way that is both mesmerizing and deceptive."

The Eddie,Tournament format,"The tournament is known for a unique requirement that open-ocean swells reach a minimum height of 20 feet (6.1 m) before the competition can be held. Open-ocean swells of this height generally translate to wave faces in the bay of 30 feet (9.1 m) to 40 feet (12 m). As a result of this requirement, the tournament has only been held ten times during the history of the event, most recently on January 22, 2023.The competition window is between December 1 and the last day of February annually, when winter storms in the North Pacific provide the energy for big waves on Oahu's North Shore. Each day, surf conditions, ocean swells, and weather forecasts are monitored by oceanographers, meteorologists, and big wave surfing experts, and provide input to the Tournament Director, who is responsible for making the official call to run the tournament. If the minimum conditions are not met during the competition window, the event is not held that year, and the process repeats itself the following December.
Each year, 28 to 40 surfers, chosen by polling among their peers, are invited to Waimea Bay to participate in the opening ceremony ""Blessing of Eddie Aikau"" on the first Thursday of December. These surfers then await an Official Call during the competition window, at which point they have 12 hours to arrive at Waimea Bay to check in the morning of the competition.  Participants compete in two rounds of about four or five waves each during the competition day, which is generally from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Each wave in the first round lasts 45 minutes, and 50 minutes in the second round. Surfers' four best-scoring waves over both rounds make up their total score.
Participants are not allowed to use personal watercraft to tow themselves into the waves; they must paddle out into the waves entirely under their own power.
Eddie Aikau's brother, Clyde Aikau, won the second ""Eddie"" in 1986.  Before Eddie's death, at 31 in 1978, the two brothers had surfed together and competitively for a number of years.  They are the only native Hawaiians to win the Duke Kahanamoku Invitational Surfing Championship.
The 2023 event included female surfers for the first time in the history of the contest."

Constant-voltage speaker system,Operation,"Constant-voltage speaker systems are analogous to electrical power transmission methods employed by electric utility companies to transmit electric power over long distances. Typically, an electric utility will step up the voltage of the power transmitted, which correspondingly reduces the current, hence reducing the power loss during transmission. The voltage is stepped down at the destination. Similarly, in a constant-voltage speaker system, the amplifier uses a transformer to step up the voltage of the audio signal to reduce power loss over the speaker cable, allowing more power to be transmitted over a given wire diameter. Each speaker in the system has a step-down transformer to reduce the voltage to a usable level."
Constant-voltage speaker system,Loudspeaker connection,"Each loudspeaker's step-down transformer can be designed for a single power level or it can have multiple taps, one of which is selected to match the desired power level to be applied to the loudspeaker. Transformers with various taps allow the installer to adjust the sound pressure level up or down at an individual loudspeaker. Purpose-built models are available that have the transformer contained within the loudspeaker enclosure.  The loudspeaker step-down transformer primary is connected in parallel to the constant-voltage line."
Constant-voltage speaker system,Amplifier connection,"Constant-voltage lines can be driven by a conventional amplifier with external step-up transformer, an amplifier with an internal step-up transformer or a high-voltage amplifier with transformerless output."
Constant-voltage speaker system,External step-up transformer,"A general-purpose amplifier with typical low-impedance output is used. Its output is connected to the primary of an external step-up transformer. Special-purpose transformers can tailor the system design to the project's target power levels. Multiple amplifiers can be combined together via transformers to yield higher voltage and higher current capacity lines. For instance, three 70-volt amplifiers have been used to make a 210-volt line by connecting them to a special-purpose external output transformer that has three primaries and a single secondary."
Constant-voltage speaker system,Internal step-up transformer,"Amplifiers with built-in 70-volt output transformers are available with low impedance and high impedance output connections, the latter typically labeled ""25 V"" and ""70 V"". These are robust, purpose-built amplifiers with many application-specific design features such as overcurrent protection and aggressive high-pass filtering for flyback voltage protection. Some models can be configured so that one channel drives one or two low impedance 8-ohm speakers while the other drives a constant-voltage string of speakers."
Constant-voltage speaker system,High voltage transformerless,"With advances in power semiconductors, it became possible to output high voltage directly from the output stage of the amplifier. For example, in 1967 Crown International introduced the DC300 amplifier, which is capable of directly driving 70-volt lines, as well as traditional speaker loads, thanks to its overall power of 500W. In 1987, Crown introduced the Macrotech 2400, capable of driving 100-volt lines directly. Since then, further developments in high-power amplifier technology have widened the choices. Many manufacturers make amplifiers capable of direct connection to a high-impedance constant-voltage speaker line. High-voltage audio amplifiers have almost become a one chip solution. For example, National Semiconductor's LME49810 (and similar products LME49811 and LME49830) can output 100 V peak to peak signals, but have relatively low current output, so a standard circuit includes a Darlington or FET discrete output stage."
Constant-voltage speaker system,Higher power levels,"High-voltage constant-voltage systems can be designed to use 140-, 200- and 210-volt lines, depending on the transformers selected and the amplifier connection topology. Such high voltage systems have been used in locations where small diameter wire is already in place, where long-distance wire runs are involved and at especially loud installations such as Daytona International Speedway and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway prior to its redesign in 2003. Safety considerations in such high voltages require speaker line installation within conduit in most of the world.
600 watt transformers are widely available for contractors needing high power loudspeakers in constant-voltage installations. Special-purpose transformers capable of handling 1250 watts down as low as 50 Hz are available. One problem with high power, high current transformers is that fewer can be used on a single constant-voltage line. Larger diameter speaker wire is recommended. Larger transformers needed for high power handling have reduced high-frequency response."
Constant-voltage speaker system,Alternatives,"The traditional alternative to constant-voltage speaker systems are low impedance speaker systems (commonly referred to as ""8-ohm speaker systems"" in spite of the fact that their impedance may not be 8 ohms), in which the amplifier and speaker are directly coupled without the use of transformers. The disadvantages relative to constant-voltage systems are that speaker cables need to be shorter or larger in diameter and that more amplifiers are needed if different listening levels are desired at different locations.
Another alternative are powered speakers with an amplifier built into the speaker enclosure.  Since the amplifier is at the same location as the speaker, the speaker requires only a line level audio signal as an input.  Line level signals are typically around 1-2 volts, and can be transmitted over much smaller cable (typically 20-26 AWG). The main disadvantage of powered loudspeakers is that they have the additional requirement of requiring AC power, whereas passive speakers have no such requirement."
Constant-voltage speaker system,Advantages,"The main advantages of using a constant-voltage speaker system over a conventional low impedance speaker system are:

Multiple loudspeakers: Many loudspeakers can be driven by a single amplifier without complex series/parallel connection schemes.
Multiple power levels: Different sound pressure level targets can be achieved at different listening areas while still using a single amplifier.
Less expensive: Since the voltage of the signal has been stepped up and the current is relatively low, lighter, less expensive cable can be used without incurring additional power loss.  Where a typical 8-ohm speaker system might require 12 gauge cable, a 70-volt system could use 18 gauge or smaller cable.
System expansion: A 70-volt system can be expanded easily.
Easy volume adjustment: A passive volume control may be installed to give the user easy level control over a single loudspeaker or a multiple-speaker zone."
Constant-voltage speaker system,Disadvantages,"Frequency Response: Inexpensive transformers may have poor reproduction of low and high frequencies.
Distortion: Overdriven transformers can add ringing distortion to the audio signal. Low cost transformers are prone to distortion at higher power levels, especially with regard to low frequency response. Low level signals can fail to energize a poorly designed transformer core enough to prevent higher than normal amounts of harmonic distortion.
Variation: Unit-to-unit variation can be observed in poorly made transformers.
Delay: More distant speakers on the same constant-voltage line cannot be delayed to match the speed of sound in air to make the impulses from a string of loudspeakers arrive at the same time from the point of view of a distant listener.
Insertion loss: The transformers themselves commonly reduce total power applied to the loudspeakers, requiring the amplifier to be some 10% to 20% more powerful than the total power that is intended to be applied to the loudspeakers. Typical transformer insertion loss measurements are taken at 1,000 Hz to optimize the transformer's specifications. Using this method, typical insertion losses are about 1 dB, a 20% power loss. Most of the power in voice-application audio systems is below 400 Hz, meaning that insertion loss at lower frequencies would be greater. The best transformers reduce mid-band frequencies by 0.5 dB (approximately 10% power loss) or less, resulting in a ten watt loudspeaker drawing 11.1 watts from the amplifier.
Capacitance: To achieve higher power levels, transformers must be physically larger. Large transformers (above 200 watts) begin to suffer from high frequency attenuation due to self-capacitance.
More expensive: If high-power loudspeakers are used with an emphasis on low frequency response, the required transformers will be much larger and will add significant cost to the project. In some areas, building and electrical codes require 70-volt cabling to be carried within conduit, increasing the project cost.
More sensitive: Since constant-voltage systems operate at relatively high impedances, they are more sensitive to small amounts of leakage current and partial short circuits. Running 70-volt speaker lines in conduit that collect water can result in crackling sounds in the system."

In 1957 he matriculated to the University of Toronto where he earned a Bachelor of Music degree in 1959.Mather attended the Aspen Music Festival and School in the summers of 1957 and 1958 through a scholarship provided by the Women's Musical Club of Toronto and the Beta Sigma Phi International Sorority. While there Alexander Uninsky introduced the young composer to Darius Milhaud and Milhaud quickly became one of his more important mentors. He continued to study with Milhaud and with Simone Plé-Caussade, Lazare Lévy, and Olivier Messiaen at the Paris Conservatoire from 1959-1961. In 1964 he received a Master of Music from Stanford University where he was a pupil of Leland Smith and Roy Harris, and in 1967 he earned a Doctor of Music from the University of Toronto."
Bruce Mather,Music,"Mather is a composer of orchestral, chamber, vocal, and piano works. A disciple of Ivan Wyschnegradsky, his music often employs microtonal scales. Though he was distrustful towards microtonal music since he heard Alois Haba's Music, his meeting with Wyschnegradsky in the seventies was crucial for his aesthetic and his use of microtonal scales. As a pianist, he and his pianist wife, Pierret Mather, have performed many of Wyschnegradsky's pieces.In his composition he still uses the famous Wyschnegrasky's principle of non-octavic spaces. He wrote many works using this technique and notably his Poème du délire (""Poem of Delirium"") a tribute to Alexander Scriabin (as a reference to his famous Poem of Ecstasy and Poem of Fire), an influential figure for him and Wyschnegradsky. His compositions are also strongly influenced by his love of poetry and wine."

Grandy Glaze,High school career,"In his freshman basketball season, Glaze attended St. Edmund Campion Secondary School in Brampton, Ontario. For the following two years, he transferred to St. John's Catholic Prep in Buckeystown, Maryland, where he played the power forward position for the Vikings. As a junior at the Mid-Atlantic Invitational at St. Maria Goretti High School in November 2008, Glaze was named tournament most valuable player (MVP) and earned all-tournament honors as his team won the championship. On February 9, 2009, he led all scorers with 31 points to help defeat McDonogh School. By the end of the season, he was averaging 18 points and 8 rebounds per game, en route to The Gazette Player of the Year accolades.As a junior, Glaze moved to Proctor Academy in Andover, New Hampshire, closing the season with averages of about 20 points and 13 rebounds per game. At the time, Rivals.com ranked him as the 83rd-best prospect in his class and among the top-20 power forwards. Glaze played his final season at the high school level for Notre Dame Preparatory School in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. On November 11, 2010, he signed a letter of intent to play for the UNLV Runnin' Rebels in college, turning down offers from Akron, South Florida, and West Virginia. However, in April 2011, after the Rebels lost head coach Lon Kruger, Glaze requested release from his UNLV commitment. On August 2, 2011, he signed with the Saint Louis Billikens to play under coach Rick Majerus."
Grandy Glaze,College career,"For the 2011–2012 season, Glaze played in a mere 9 games as reserve power forward for the Billikens. Against Alabama State, he played 10 minutes while recording 2 points, 3 rebounds, and an assist. Glaze dislocated his shoulder in November 2012 after diving for a loose ball against Texas A&M and missed the next five games. Glaze played in 25 games, a sizable increase in playing time, and had 20 starts. Glaze's best game came against conference foe Duquesne where he tallied 8 points, 10 rebounds, and 2 steals. The 2012–13 Saint Louis Billikens men's basketball team went 28–7 and earned the Billikens a 4 seed in the NCAA Tournament, where they eventually lost in the 3rd Round to 12th seeded Oregon. He averaged 3.1 points and 2.6 rebounds per game as a sophomore.

Glaze played in all 34 games as a junior while making 6 starts for the Billikens. In the team's opener, Glaze scored 16 points on 7 of 7 shooting and grabbed 10 rebounds while the Billikens defeated Southeast Missouri State 87–64. Glaze followed up this career game with another notable performance against Southern Illinois Edwardsville where he scored 9 points, tallied 14 rebounds, and dished out an assist. After these two career games, Glaze continued to play well and had another strong performance with 14 points in a 67–65 win over Valparaiso on December 7. Glaze logged few minutes during conference play. The Billikens, however, went on a winning streak which eventually placed them in the AP Poll as high as #10. St. Louis ended up being a 5 seed in the NCAA Tournament, where the Billikens won in one of the greatest comebacks in NCAA Tournament history against North Carolina State, rallying from 14 down to win in OT. He averaged 3.8 points and 4.5 rebounds as a junior in 12.9 minutes per game. Even though his numbers weren't impressive, Glaze specialized in activities that did not show up on box scores such as setting screens, boxing out on rebounds, and playing strong defense.Glaze came into the 2014–15 season expecting to be in the starting lineup and play major minutes for the Billikens due to graduating players. However, before the season started Glaze re-injured his shoulder in practice and was officially ruled out for a few weeks. He ended up having to sit out the entire season due to surgery on that shoulder. On May 11, Glaze officially transferred to Grand Canyon University. He chose the Antelopes over offers from Wyoming and New Mexico and did not need to sit out a year, as he was a graduate transfer. Glaze scored a career-high 29 points in a 108–104 loss to Omaha on December 13, 2015. In his only season at Grand Canyon, he finished eighth in the Western Athletic Conference in scoring with 14.0 points per game, second in rebounding with 8.8 per game, and first in field goal percentage with 59.6 percent. Glaze led the team to a 27–7 record and earned the 2016 Riley Wallace Award for best college basketball transfer. He was also named second team National Association of Basketball Coaches All-Region 6 and second team All-WAC. Glaze received the Most Valuable Player award in the first John McLendon Classic during the first-round CollegeInsider.com Tournament game."
Grandy Glaze,Professional career,"After graduation, Glaze worked out with the Philadelphia 76ers in anticipation for the 2016 NBA draft. He was drafted by their D-League affiliate the Delaware 87ers with the seventh pick of the third round in the 2016 NBA Development League Draft. He was one of four WAC players taken in the D-League draft. However, he never played for the 87ers and instead debuted for Correcaminos of the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional in Mexico. Glaze averaged 16 points, 12.3 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game. He led the league in rebounding but Correcaminos, which is owned by the Autonomous University of Tamaulipas, finished last in league standings. In March 2017 Glaze signed with the Caballeros de Culiacán of the Circuito de Baloncesto de la Costa del Pacífico, another league in Mexico.In November 2017, Glaze was signed by the St. John's Edge, an expansion team in NBL Canada. He was dominant in the early season, contributing 19 points and 20 rebounds against the Island Storm, and posting 18 points and 17 rebounds the following game versus the Halifax Hurricanes. Glaze missed four games in November due to representing Canada in qualification matches for the FIBA Basketball World Cup. In a game versus the London Lightning on March 3, 2018, Glaze left the bench during a melee in which Carl English was tripped up. Glaze was ejected and was suspended the following game by the league. In their first season in play, the Edge reached the Central Division finals, losing to the London Lightning. He averaged 7.3 points and 6.1 rebounds per game for the Edge, shooting 60 percent on field goals. Glaze was named to the Third Team All-Canadian.In September 2018, Glaze's rights were traded by the St. John's Edge to the Windsor Express in exchange for Maurice Jones. Days later, his rights were traded to the Sudbury Five for those of Juan Pattillo. On October 12, 2018, Glaze signed with the Five. He averaged 13.9 points and 11.6 rebounds per game in 16 games.In January 2019, Glaze signed with Colegio Los Leones de Quilpué of the Liga Nacional de Básquetbol de Chile. Glaze briefly joined the Eltham Wildcats of the upstart Australian NBL1 but was released in April 2019. He joined the Edmonton Stingers for the inaugural season of the Canadian Elite Basketball League. On July 11, 2019, Glaze had 28 points and 15 rebounds in a 110-91 win over the Guelph Nighthawks. In 19 games he averaged 10.8 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 2.4 assists per game. Glaze briefly played for Capitanes de Ciudad de México of the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional, where in two games he averaged 29 points, eight rebounds, two steals, and 1.5 assists per game. In November 2019, Glaze signed with Al Ahli in Jordan.In the summer of 2020, Glaze rejoined the Caballeros de Culiacán and had nine points, five rebounds, and four assists in his only game. On July 2, 2020, he signed with the Niagara River Lions of the Canadian Elite Basketball League."

Yaron Tsur,The Open University,"In 1975 Tsur began a long lasting association with the Open University of Israel. Initially he co-designed 'From Jerusalem to Yavneh', the first course in the field of Jewish history to appear under the auspices of this unique and brand new institution. Subsequently, he chaired
the academic team that produced 'Jews in a period of transformations', a course that for the next three and a half decades would offer Open University students a challenging survey of the Modern Jewish experience. At the height of his tenure Tsur designed a series of advanced courses in tandem with his own research interest in Jewish history in Islamic lands during the modern period. The first course book produced as part of this effort, co-authored with Dr. Hagar Hillel, was a study of the community of Casablanca during the colonial period."
Yaron Tsur,Tel Aviv University,"As of 1990 Tsur has been on the faculty of the Jewish history department at Tel Aviv University, his main academic home. Rising through the ranks he briefly served as chair of the department (2007) before being tapped to chair the university's Chaim Rosenberg graduate school of Jewish studies. During his TAU tenure Tsur has taught numerous surveys, as well as advanced courses in his fields of expertise."
Yaron Tsur,Scholarship,
Yaron Tsur,Tunisia,"Tsur's entry point into the field of Jewish history in Islamic lands was his study of the formation of French policy toward Tunisia's Jewish minority as the country ceased to be a sovereign Muslim state and became a European colonial possession. In this trailblazing work Tsur identified the dominant and unprecedented role played by Western European Jewish organizations and entities in determining the direction Jewish existence in the world of Islam would now take in tandem with colonial penetration and designs. Subsequently, Tsur would concur with Edward Said's model of Orientalism Orientalism as a heuristic device for comprehending the European-non European relationship during the colonial era."
Yaron Tsur,Jewish Society in Colonial North Africa; A 'sectional' society,"In his monograph Torn Community: The Jews of Morocco and Nationalism 1943–1954, as well as in related essays, Tsur suggests complementing two classic models of stratification in colonial societies; class, determined by economic potential, as well as the more basic hierarchy between 'European' and 'native', with a third category of analysis based on the individual's cultural capital. The latter component, to Tsur's way of thinking, provides class determinism with a greater measure of historical agency, at the same time it manages to soften the rigid distinction between European and native. In the specifically Jewish context this provides for a whole host of possibilities with one individual belonging to multiple sectors and even serving as an invaluable mediator between them. The dynamic nature of the field as historically reconstructed by Tsur allows for more change and mobility between sections or actual economic markets.An important distinction offered by Tsur in this context is that of 'Westernized' individuals, whose preferred means of communication are one or multiple European languages, as opposed to the Maskil, a type still within the native camp, but adamantly promoting modernization by means of native mediums of communication such as the shared language of high culture, Hebrew, as well as a local Judeo-Arabic dialect.
After successfully testing his model on North African soil, Tsur has used it to probe pre-colonial Jewish societies that still functioned within an imperial setting, i.e. the Ottoman Empire. He has also utilized it in order to gain fresh insight into the strained relations that existed between Mercantile (especially Western) Sephardi satellite communities and local Arabized ones."
Yaron Tsur,Israel's Ethnic problem,"Not surprisingly, Tsur is equally keen to find out how contacts between European and non-European within the Jewish polity have been transformed during the Zionist era, as well as on the ground in Jewish Palestine. Accordingly, he finds complexity where more rigid post-colonial minded scholars would prefer to concentrate solely on rigid dichotomies. According to Tsur's findings, if in the pre-state Yishuv Zionist technocrats were already directing non-European arrivals to fulfill menial roles and peripheral niches, all the more so when already in 1949 Ashkenazi spokesmen sounded doomsday warnings of how the Western seeming success story of the New Hebrew state would be permanently damaged by the Asiatic hordes now nocking at Israel's doors.
To be sure, previous (and mostly apologetic) interpretations of the curbing of the mass Aliyah from French North Africa, first and foremost Morocco, by means of a medical selective process and series of quotas, rested solely on economic considerations that had been articulated by representative bodies of the absorbing apparatus such as relevant departments of the Jewish agency. Tsur, however, has successfully examined things afresh and introduced into the equation naked cultural fears, and even panic publicly voiced by the Ashkenazi leadership of the Jewish state. He has originally tracked the subsequent history of Israeli ethnic strife as being a two-sided conflict; occasionally exacerbated discretely by the Ashkenazi elite (1949 and 1984) and in other times (1959 and 1971) openly ignited by the Mizrahi subaltern class.In so doing Tsur identifies two, partly contradictory world forces at play, nationalism and colonialism, constantly shaping and reshaping relations between European Jews and the Jews of Asia and Africa in the modern period. As an Israeli historian with a deep interest in the annals of Israeli society, Tsur sees this creative tension as vital force in shaping both ethnic stratification but also occasional mobility within the Jewish polity.
In recent years Tsur has returned to exploring Jewish-Muslim relations in various pre-modern and modern settings."
Yaron Tsur,Digital Humanities,"Tsur has enjoyed a parallel career as an academic entrepreneur in the currently blossoming field of the digital humanities. His first efforts in this direction was the creation of a 'Jews from Islamic lands' heritage website under the auspices of Tel Aviv University's humanities faculty, where students would have access to mainly secondary material on the subject, especially scanned for this purpose, as well as to maps and other means of visual illustration that enhance and enrich their learning experience. Eventually this website began a continuing association with the Israeli ministry of Education, and is now expanding its content.In 2004 Tsur founded 'website of Jewish newspapers', renamed a year later 'Jewish historical press' (JPress).  A now joint venture of TAU and Israel's National Library, the technological breakthrough that made this site possible is a search engine capable of multi-lingual searches of scores of Jewish serials from around the world; a cultural milestone in and of itself. A second's long search was now transforming a scholarly once very taxing for the modern Jewish historian or otherwise interested individual. The initial goal had been to scan the entire Hebrew language press; a still ongoing task. Serials now searchable include Doar Hayom, Davar, Al-Hamishmar, Maariv, Hatzofeh and Herut, as well as dozens of others. Since then, however, many other Jewish languages have found a home on this website, such as Ladino, Judeo-Arabic, Yiddish, not to mention European tongues such as English, French, Polish and Hungarian. With close to 1.5 million pages already scanned and searchable, this once modest enterprise is now a global treasure trove of information on Modern Jewry, of which Tsur serves as academic director and editor in chief."
Yaron Tsur,Prizes and Academic activities and achievements,"Tsur has spent sabbaticals and taught at a host of institutions abroad such as the Sorbonne in Paris, as well as in the EHESS. In the United States he has been a fellow at both the Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, and at the Frankel Institute at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. He has also taught at the Jewish Theological Seminary and recently in NYU. His Torn Community was awarded the Shazar prize in 2002 and the Toledano prize a year later. From the municipality of Paris Tsur received a medal honoring his efforts in establishing ties between Israeli and Tunisian historians."

Tenedos,Name,"The island is known in English as both Tenedos (the Greek name) and Bozcaada (the Turkish name). Over the centuries many other names have been used. Documented ancient Greek names for the island are Leukophrys, Calydna, Phoenice and Lyrnessus (Pliny, HN 5,140). The official Turkish name for the island is Bozcaada; the Turkish word ""boz"" means either a barren land or grey to brown color (sources indicate both of these meanings may have been associated with the island) and ""ada"" meaning island. The name Tenedos was derived, according to Apollodorus of Athens, from the Greek hero Tenes, who ruled the island at the time of the Trojan War and was killed by Achilles. Apollodorus writes that the island was originally known as Leocophrys until Tenes landed on the island and became the ruler. The island became known as Bozcaada when the Ottoman Empire took the island over. Tenedos remained a common name for the island along with Bozcaada after the Ottoman conquest of the island, often with Greek populations and Turkish populations using different names for the island."
Tenedos,Geography and climate,"Tenedos is roughly triangular in shape. Its area is 39.9 km2 (15 sq mi). It is the third largest Turkish island after Marmara Island and Imbros (Gökçeada). It is surrounded by small islets, and is situated close to the entrance of the Dardanelles. It is the only rural district (ilçe) of Turkey without any villages, and has only one major settlement, the town center.
Geological evidence suggests that the island broke away from the mainland producing a terrain that is mainly plains in the west with hills in the Northeast, and the highest point is 192 metres (630 ft). The central part of the island is the most amenable to agricultural activities. There is a small pine forest in the Southwestern part of the island.  The westernmost part of the island has large sandy areas not suitable for agriculture.The island has a Mediterranean climate with strong northern winds called etesians.  Average temperature is 14 °C (57 °F) and average annual precipitation is 529 millimetres (20.8 in). There are a number of small streams running from north to south at the southwestern part of the island. Freshwater sources though are not enough for the island so water is piped in from the mainland."
Tenedos,History,
Tenedos,Prehistory,"Archeological findings indicate that the first human settlement on the island dates back to the Early Bronze Age II (ca. 3000–2700 BC). Archaeological evidence suggests the culture on the island had elements in common with the cultures of northwestern Anatolia and the Cycladic Islands.  Most settlement was on the small bays on the east side of the island which formed natural harbours. Settlement archaeological work was done quickly and thus did not find definitive evidence of grape cultivation on the island during this period. However, grape cultivation was common on neighboring islands and the nearby mainland during this time.According to a reconstruction, based on the myth of Tenes, Walter Leaf stated that the first inhabitants of the island could be Pelasgians, who were driven out of the Anatolian mainland by the Phrygians. According to the same author, there are possible traces of Minoan and Mycenaean Greek influence in the island."
Tenedos,Antiquity,"Ancient Tenedos is referred to in Greek and Roman mythology, and archaeologists have uncovered evidence of its settlement from the Bronze Age. It would stay prominent through the age of classical Greece, fading by the time of the dominance of ancient Rome. Although a small island, Tenedos's position in the straits and its two harbors made it important to the Mediterranean powers over the centuries. For nine months of the year, the currents and the prevailing wind, the etesian, came, and still come, from the Black Sea hampering sailing vessels headed for Constantinople. They had to wait a week or more at Tenedos, waiting for the favorable southerly wind. Tenedos thus served as a shelter and way station for ships bound for the Hellespont, Propontis, Bosphorus, and places farther on. Several of the regional powers captured or attacked the island, including the Athenians, the Persians, the Macedonians under Alexander the Great, the Seleucids and the Attalids."
Tenedos,Mythology,"Homer mentions Apollo as the chief deity of Tenedos in his time. According to him, the island was captured by Achilles during the siege of Troy. Nestor obtained his slave Hecamede there during one of Achilles's raids. Nestor also sailed back from Troy stopping at Tenedos and island-hopping to Lesbos. The Odyssey mentions the Greeks leaving Troy after winning the war first traveled to nearby Tenedos, sacrificed there, and then went to Lesbos before pausing to choose between alternative routes.Homer, in the Iliad mention that between Tenedos and Imbros there was a wide cavern, in which Poseidon stayed his horses.Virgil, in the Aeneid, described the Achaeans hiding their fleet at the bay of Tenedos, toward the end of the Trojan War, to trick Troy into believing the war was over and allowing them to take the Trojan Horse within Troy's city walls. In Aeneid, it is also the island from which twin serpents came to kill the Trojan priest Laocoön and his sons as punishment for throwing a spear at the Trojan Horse. According to Pindar (Nemean Odes no. 11), the island was founded after the war by bronze-clad warriors from Amyklai, traveling with Orestes.According to myth, Tenes was the son of Cycnus, himself the son of Poseidon and Calyce. Philonome, Cycnus's second wife and hence Tenes's stepmother, tried to seduce Tenes and was rejected. She then accused him of rape leading to his abandonment at sea along with his sister. They washed up on the island of Leucophrys where he was proclaimed king and the island renamed Tenedos in his honor. When Cycnus realized the lie behind the allegations he took a ship to apologize to his son. The myths differ on whether they reconciled. According to one version, when the father landed on the island of Tenedos, Tenes cut the cord holding his boat. The phrase 'hatchet of Tenes' came to mean resentment that could not be soothed. Another myth had Achilles landing on Tenedos, while sailing from Aulis to Troy. There his navy stormed the island, and Achilles fought Tenes, in this myth a son of Apollo, and killed him, not knowing Tenes's lineage and hence unaware of the danger of Apollo's revenge. Achilles would also later kill Tenes's father, Cycnus, at Troy. In Sophocles's Philoctetes, written in 409 BC, a serpent bit Philoctetes in the foot at Tenedos. According to Hyginus, the goddess Hera, upset with Philoctetes for helping Hercules, had sent the snake to punish him. His wound refused to heal, and the Greeks abandoned him, before going back to him for help later during the attack on Troy. Athenaeus quoted Nymphodorus's remarks on the beauty of the women of Tenedos.Callimachus talked of a myth in which Ino's son Melikertes washed up dead in Tenedos after being thrown into the sea by his mother, who killed herself too; the residents, Lelegians, built an altar for Melikertes and started a ritual of a woman sacrificing her infant child when the town's need was dire. The woman would then be blinded. The myths also added that the custom was abolished when Orestes' descendants settled the place.Neoptolemus stayed two days at Tenedos, following the advice of Thetis, before he go to the land of the Molossians together with Helenus."
Tenedos,Archaic period,"It was at Tenedos, along with Lesbos, that the first coins with Greek writing on them were minted. Figures of bunches of grapes and wine vessels such as amphorae and kantharoi were stamped on coins. The very first coins had a twin head of a male and a female on the obverse side. The early coins were of silver and had a double-headed axe imprinted on them. Aristotle considered the axe as symbolizing the decapitation of those convicted of adultery, a Tenedian decree. The axe-head was either a religious symbol or the seal of a trade unit of currency. Apollo Smintheus, a god who both protected against and brought about plague, was worshipped in late Bronze Age Tenedos. Strabo's Geography writes that Tenedos ""contains an Aeolian city and has two harbours, and a temple of Apollo Smintheus"" (Strabo's Geography, Vol. 13). The relationship between Tenedos and Apollo is mentioned in Book I of the Iliad where a priest calls to Apollo with the name ""O god of the silver bow, that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos with thy might""(Iliad I).During the later part of the Bronze Age and during the Iron Age, the place served as a major point between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Homer's Iliad mentions the Tenedos of this era. The culture and artisanship of the area, as represented by pottery and metal vessels recovered from graves, matched that of the northeastern Aegean. Archaeologists have found no evidence to substantiate Herodotus's assertion Aeolians had settled in Tenedos by the Bronze Age. Homer mentions Tenedos as a base for the Achaean fleet during the Trojan war.The Iron Age settlement of the northeast Aegean was once attributed to Aeolians, descendants of Orestes and hence of the House of Atreus in Mycenae, from across the Aegean from Thessaly, Boiotia and Akhaia, all in mainland Greece. Pindar, in his 11th Nemean Ode, hints at a group of Peloponnesians, the children of the fighters at Troy, occupying Tenedos, with Orestes, the son of Agamemnon, landing straight on the island; specifically he refers to a Spartan Peisandros and his descendant Aristagoras, with Peisandaros having come over with Orestes. Strabo places the start of the migration sixty years after the Trojan war, initiated by Orestes's son, Penthilos, with the colonization continuing onto Penthilos's grandson.The archaeological record provides no supporting evidence for the theory of Aiolian occupation. During the pre-archaic period, adults in Lesbos were buried by placing them in large jars, and later clay coverings were used, similar to Western Asia Minor. Still later, Tenedians began to both bury and cremate their adults in pits buttressed with stone along the walls. Children were still buried covered in jars. Some items buried with the person, such as pottery, gifts and safety-pin-like clasps, resemble what is found in Anatolia, in both style and drawings and pictures, more than they resemble burial items in mainland Greece.While human, specifically infant, sacrifice has been mentioned in connection with Tenedos's ancient past, it is now considered mythical in nature. The hero Paleomon in Tenedos was worshipped by a cult in that island, and the sacrifices were attributed to the cult. At Tenedos, people did sacrifice a newborn calf dressed in buskins, after treating the cow like a pregnant women giving birth; the person who killed the calf was then stoned and driven out into a life on the sea. According to Harold Willoughby, a belief in the calf as a ritual incarnation of God drove this practice."
Tenedos,Classical period,"From the Archaic to Classical period, the archaeological evidence of well-stocked graves establishes Tenedos's continuing affluence. Tall, broad-mouthed containers show grapes and olives were likely processed during this time. They were also used to bury dead infants. By the fourth century BC, grapes and wine had become relevant to the economy of the island. Tenedians likely exported surplus wine. Writings from this era talk of a shortage of agricultural land, indicating a booming settlement. A dispute with the neighboring island of Sigeum was arbitrated by Periander of Corinth, who handed over political control of a swath of the mainland to Tenedos. In the first century BC this territory was eventually incorporated into Alexandria Troas.According to some accounts, Thales of Greece died in Tenedos. Cleostratus, an astronomer, lived and worked in Tenedos, though it is unknown whether he met Thales there. Cleostratus is one of the founders of Greek astronomy, influenced as it was by the reception of Babylonian knowledge. Athens had a naval base on the island in the fifth and fourth century BC. Demosthenes mentions Apollodorus, a trierarch commanding a ship, talking of buying food during a stopover at Tenedos where he would pass the trierarchy to Polycles. In 493 BCE, the Persians overran Tenedos along with other Greek islands. During his reign, Philip II of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great, sent a Macedonian force sailing against the Persian fleet. Along with other Aegean islands such as Lesbos, Tenedos also rebelled against the Persian dominance at this time. Athens seemingly augmented its naval base with a fleet at the island around 450 BC.During the campaign of Alexander the Great against the Persians, Pharnabazus, the Persian commander, laid siege to Tenedos with a hundred ships and eventually captured it as Alexander could not send a fleet in time to save the island. The island's walls were demolished and the islanders had to accept the old treaty with the Persian emperor Artaxerxes II: the Peace of Antalcidas. Later, Alexander's commander Hegelochus of Macedon captured the island from the Persians. Alexander made an alliance with the people in Tenedos in order to limit the Persian naval power. He also took on board 3000 Greek mercenaries and oarsmen from Tenedos in his army and navy.The land was not suitable for large-scale grazing or extensive agriculture. Local grapes and wines were mentioned in inscriptions and on coins. But Pliny and other contemporary writers did not mention grapes and wines at the island. Most exports were via sea, and both necessities and luxuries had to imported, again by sea. Unlike in Athens, it is unclear whether Tenedos ever had a democracy. Marjoram (Oregano) from Tenedos was one of the relishes used in Greek cuisine.
The Tenedians punished adulterers by cutting off their heads with an axe. Aristotle wrote about the social and political structure of Tenedos. He found it notable a large part of the populace worked in occupations related to ferries, possibly hundreds in a population of thousands. Pausanias noted some common proverbs in Greek originated from customs of the Tenedians. ""He is a man of Tenedos"" was used to allude to a person of unquestionable integrity, and ""to cut with the Tenedian axe"" was a full and final 'no'. Lykophron, writing in the second century BC, referred to the deity Melikertes as the ""baby-slayer"". Xenophon described the Spartans' sacking the place in 389 BC, but being beaten back by an Athenian fleet when trying again two years later.In Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax writes that the astronomer Kleostratos (Ancient Greek: Κλεόστρατος) was from Tenedos."
Tenedos,Hellenistic period,"In the Hellenistic period, the Egyptian goddess Isis was also worshipped at Tenedos. There she was associated closely with the sun, with her name and title reflecting that position."
Tenedos,Roman period,"During the Roman occupation of Greece, Tenedos too came under their rule. The island became a part of the Roman Republic in 133 BC, when Attalus III, the king of Pergamon, died, leaving his territory to the Romans. The Romans constructed a new port at Alexandria Troas, on the Dardanelle Strait. This led to Tenedos's decline. Tenedos lost its importance during this period. Virgil, in Aeneid, stated the harbour was deserted and ships could not moor in the bay during his time. Processing of grapes seems to have been abandoned. Olive cultivation and processing did possibly continue, though there was likely no surplus to export. Archaeological evidence indicates the settlement was mostly in the town, with only a few scattered sites in the countryside.According to Strabo there was a kinship between the peoples of Tenedos and Tenea (a town at Corinth).According to Cicero a number of deified human beings were worshipped in Greece: in Tenedos there was Tenes.Pausanias, mention at his work Description of Greece that Periklyto, who was from Tenedos, has dedicated some axes at Delphoi.During the Third Mithridatic War, in around 73 BC, Tenedos was the site of a large naval battle between Roman commander Lucullus and the fleet of the king of Pontus, Mithridates, commanded by Neoptolemus. This Battle of Tenedos was won decisively by the Romans. Around 81–75 BC, Verres, legate of the Governor of Cilicia, Gaius Dolabella, plundered the island, carrying off the statue of Tenes and some money. Towards 6 BC, geographical change made the mainland port less useful, and Tenedos became relevant again. According to Dio Chrysostom and Plutarch, Tenedos was famous for its pottery ca AD 100. Under Rome's protection, Tenedos restarted its mint after a break of more than a century. The mint continued with the old designs, improving on detail and precision. Cicero, writing in this era, noted the temple built to honor Tenes, the founder whose name the island received, and of the harsh justice system of the populace."
Tenedos,Byzantine period,"When Constantinople became a prominent city in the Roman Empire, from AD 350 on, Tenedos became a crucial trading post. Emperor Justinian I ordered the construction of a large granary on Tenedos and ferries between the island and Constantinople became a major activity on the island. Ships carrying grain from Egypt to Constantinople stopped at Tenedos when the sea was unfavorable. The countryside was likely not heavily populated or utilized. There were vineyards, orchards and corn fields, at times abandoned due to disputes.The Eastern Orthodox Church placed the diocese of Tenedos under the metropolitanate of Mytilini during the ninth century, and promoted it to its own metropolitanate in early fourteenth century. By this time Tenedos was part of the Byzantine Empire but its location made it a key target of the Venetians, the Genoese, and the Ottoman Empire. The weakened Byzantine Empire and wars between Genoa and Venice for trade routes made Tenedos a key strategic location. In 1304, Andrea Morisco, a Genoese adventurer, backed by a title from the Byzantine emperor Andronikos III, took over Tenedos. Later, sensing political tension in the Byzantine empire just before the Second Byzantine Civil War, the Venetians offered 20,000 ducats in 1350 to John V Palaiologos for control of Tenedos. When John V was captured in the Byzantine civil war, he was deported to Tenedos by John VI Kantakouzenos.John V eventually claimed victory in the civil war, but the cost was significant debt, mainly to the Venetians. In the summer of 1369, John V sailed to Venice and apparently offered the island of Tenedos in exchange for twenty-five thousand ducats and his own crown jewels. However, his son (Andronikos IV Palaiologos), acting as the regent in Constantinople, rejected the deal possibly because of Genoese pressure. Andronikos tried but failed to depose his father. In 1376, John V sold the island to Venice on the same terms as before. This upset the Genoese of Galata. The Genoese helped the imprisoned Andronikos to escape and depose his father. Andronikos repaid the favor ceding them Tenedos. But the garrison on the island refused the agreement and gave control over to the Venetians.The Venetians established an outpost on the island, a move that caused significant tension with the Byzantine Empire (then represented by Andronikos IV)and the Genoese. In the Treaty of Turin, which ended the War of Chioggia between Venice and Genoa, the Venetians were to hand over control of the island to Amadeo of Savoy and the Genoese were to pay the bill for the removal of all fortifications on the island. The Treaty of Turin specified that the Venetians would destroy all the island's ""castles, walls, defences, houses and habitations from top to bottom 'in such fashion that the place can never be rebuilt or reinhabited"". The Greek populace was not a party to the negotiations, but were to be paid for being uprooted. The baillie of Tenedos, Zanachi Mudazzo, refused to evacuate the place, and the Doge of Venice, Antonio Venier, protested the expulsion. The senators of Venice reaffirmed the treaty, the proposed solution of handing the island back to the Emperor seen as unacceptable to the Genoese. Toward the end of 1383, the population of almost 4000 was shipped out to Euboea and Crete. Buildings on the island were then razed leaving it empty. Venetians continued to use the harbor.The Venetians were zealous guarding the right to Tenedos the Treaty of Turin provided them. The Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes wanted to build a fortification at the island in 1405, with the knights bearing the cost, but the Venetians refused to allow this. The island remained largely uninhabited for the next decades. When Ruy Gonzáles de Clavijo visited the island in 1403 he remarked that because of the Treaty of Turin ""Tenedos has since come to be uninhabited."" 29 May 1416 saw the first battle at sea between the Venetians and the emerging Ottoman fleet at Gallipoli. The Venetian captain-general, Pietro Loredan, won, wiped out the Turks on board, and retired down the coast to Tenedos, where he killed all the non-Turk prisoners who had voluntarily joined the Turks. In the treaty of 1419 between Sultan Mehmed and the Venetians, Tenedos was the dividing line beyond which the Turkish fleet was not to advance. Spanish adventurer Pedro Tafur visited the island in 1437 and found it deserted, with many rabbits, the vineyards covering the island in disrepair, but the port well-maintained. He mentioned frequent Turkish attacks on shipping in the harbor. In 1453, the port was used by the commander of a single-ship Venetian fleet, Giacomo Loredan, as a monitoring point to observe the Turkish fleet, on his way to Constantinople in what would become the final defense of that city against the Turks."
Tenedos,Ottoman period,"Tenedos was occupied by Sultan Mehmet II in 1455, two years after his Conquest of Constantinople ending the Byzantine empire. It became the first island controlled by the Ottoman Empire in the Aegean sea. The island was still uninhabited at that time, almost 75 years after it had been forcefully evacuated. Mehmet II rebuilt the island's fort. During his reign the Ottoman navy used the island as a supply base. The Venetians, realizing the strategic importance of the island, deployed forces on it. Giacopo Loredano took Tenedos for Venice in 1464. The same year, Ottoman Admiral Mahmud Pasha recaptured the island. During the Ottoman regime, the island was repopulated (by granting a tax exemption). The Ottoman fleet admiral and cartographer, Piri Reis, in his book Kitab-i-Bahriye, completed in 1521, included a map of the shore and the islands off it, marking Tenedos as well. He noted that ships heading north from Smyrna to the Dardanelles passed usually through the seven-mile strip of sea between the island and the mainland.Tommaso Morosini of Venice set out with 23 ships from Crete on 20 March 1646, heading to Istanbul. They stopped at Tenedos, but failed to establish a foothold there when their ship caught fire, killing many of the crew. In 1654, Hozam Ali of the Turkish fleet landed at the island, gathering Turkish forces for a naval battle against the Venetians. This, the Battle of the Dardanelles (1654), the first of four in a series, the Ottomans won. After the Battle of the Dardanelles in 1656, Barbaro Badoer of the Venetians seized the island on 8 July. The Ottoman defeat weakened its Sultan Mehmed IV, then aged 16, and strengthened the Grand Vizier, Köprülü Mehmed Pasha.

In March 1657, an Ottoman Armada emerged through the Dardanelles, slipping through a Venetian blockade, with the objective of retaking the island but did not attempt to do so, concerned by the Venetian fleet. In July 1657, Köprülü made a decision to break the Venetian blockade and retake the territory. The Peace Party in the Venetian senate thought it best to not defend Tenedos, and Lemnos, and debated this with the War Party. Köprülü ended the argument by recapturing Tenedos on 31 August 1657, in the Battle of the Dardanelles (1657), the fourth and final one.

Following the victory, the Grand Vizier visited the island and oversaw its repairs, during which he funded construction of a mosque, which was to be called by his name. According to the Mosque's Foundation's book, it was built on the site of an older mosque, called Mıhçı Mosque which was destroyed during Venetian occupation. By the time Köprülü died in September 1661, he had built on the island the businesses of a coffee-house, a bakery, 84 shops, and nine mills; a watermill; two mosques; a school; a rest stop for travelers and a stable; and a bath-house.Rabbits which drew the attention of Tafur two-and-a-half centuries ago were apparently still abundant in the mid 17th century. In 1659 the traveler Evliya Çelebi was sent to the island with the task of collecting game for the Sultan Mehmed IV. The disorder of the 1600s hampered supply lines and caused grain shortages in Bozcaada.As a result of the series of setbacks Ottomans faced in Rumelia during the later years of the reign of Mehmed IV, with the Grand Vizier being Sarı Süleyman Pasha, the forces at the island are reported to have mutinied in 1687 with parts of the rest of the army. These widespread mutinies would result in the deposing of the Sultan and the Grand Vizier that year.In 1691 the Venetians and allies formed a war council to discuss retaking the island. The council met regularly at the galley of Domenico Mocenigo, the captain-general of the Venetian fleet. By this time, the only people on the island were those in the fort. Mocenigo estimated their number to be around 300, and the fort to be weakly buttressed. On 17 July 1691 the war council met off the waters of the island and decided to retake Tenedos since it was, per their estimate, weakly defended but famous. As a first step they decided to gather information. At their next meeting, six days later, they learned from captured slaves that the Turkish garrison, numbering around 3000, had drug trenches and strengthened their defenses. The plan to retake the island was abandoned. Venetians would try to capture Tenedos unsuccessfully in 1697.The Peace of Karlowitz, which for the first time brought the Ottomans into the mainstream of European diplomacy, was signed on 26 January 1699 by the Ottomans, the Venetians, and a large number of Europeans powers. The Venetian senate sent its ambassador, Soranzo to Istanbul via Tenedos. At the island he was greeted with a royal reception of cannon fire and by the Pasha of the island himself.During the classical Ottoman period, the island was a kadiluk. The Ottomans built mosques, fountains, hammams, and a medrese. The Ottomans adopted the Byzantine practice of using islands as places for the internal exile of state prisoners, such as Constantine Mourousis and Halil Hamid Pasha. In October 1633, Cyril Contari, Metropolitan of Aleppo in the Orthodox Church, was made the patriarch after promising to pay the Ottoman central authority 50,000 dollars. His inability to pay led to his being exiled to the island for a short time.In 1807, a joint fleet of the Russians and British captured the island during the Russo-Turkish Wars, with the Russians using it as their military base to achieve the victories at the Dardanelles and Athos; but they ceded control as part of the Treaty of Armistice with the Ottoman Porte. However, the Russian occupations proved to be destructive for the island. The town was burnt down, the harbor was almost filled in and almost all buildings were destroyed. The islanders fled and Tenedos became deserted once more.In 1822, during the Greek War of Independence, the revolutionaries under Konstantinos Kanaris managed to attack an Ottoman fleet and burn one of its ships off Tenedos. This event was a major morale booster for the Greek Revolution and attracted the attention of the European Powers. The trees that covered the island were destroyed during the war.During the 19th century, the wine production remained a profitable business while the island's annual wheat production was only enough for three months of the islanders' consumption. Apart from wine, the only export item of the island was a small quantity of wool. Also in the 19th century there had been attempts to introduce pear, fig and mulberry trees. However, there are reports of fruit, especially fig trees being present on the island prior to those attempts.The 1852 law of the Tanzimat reorganized Turkish islands and Tenedos ended up in the sanjak of Bosje Adassi (Bozcaada), in the Vilayet Jazaǐri. In July 1874, a fire destroyed the place. In 1876, a middle school was added to those on the island, with 22 students and teaching Turkish, Arabic and Persian. By 1878, the island had 2015 males, of whom almost a quarter were Muslim, in around 800 houses. The place also hosted a company of the Ottoman foot-artillery division, along with an Austrian and French vice-consulate. The island was in the sanjak of Bigha, which seated a General Governor. Around 500 casks of gunpowder, left behind by the Russians in a military storehouse, were still there. The fort accommodated the Turkish military camp, a grain silo and two wells.In 1854, there were some 4,000 inhabitants on the island of Tenedos, of which one-third were Turks. Also, there was only one Greek school on the island with about 200 students.According to the Ottoman general census of 1893, the population of the island was divided as follows: 2,479 Greeks, 1,247 Turks, 103 Foreign Nationals and 6 Armenians.By the early 20th century, the island, still under the Turks, had around 2000 people living in wooden houses with gardens. The port provided shelter for ships from the violent northerly winds. The British had a vice consul at the island. The town served as a telegraph station, with an Austrian ship coming in every two weeks. In 1906 the town imports were at 17, 950 liras and exports, mainly wine and raisins, worth 6,250 liras. There were telegraph cables laid in the sea near the port."
Tenedos,Between Turkey and Greece,
Tenedos,1912-1921,"During the First Balkan War, on 20 October 1912, Tenedos was the first island of the north Aegean that came under the control of the Greek Navy. The Turks that constituted part of Tenedos' population did not welcome the Greek control. By taking over the islands in the Northern Aegean sea, the Greek Navy limited the ability of the Ottoman fleet to move through the Dardanelles. Greek administration of the island lasted until 12 November 1922.Negotiations to end the Balkan war started in December 1912 in London and the issue of the Aegean islands was one persistent problem. The issue divided the great powers with Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy supporting the Ottoman position for return of all the Aegean islands and Britain and France supporting the Greek position for Greek control of all the Aegean islands. With Italy controlling key islands in the region, major power negotiations deadlocked in London and later in Bucharest. Romania threatened military action with the Greeks against the Ottomans in order to force negotiations in Athens in November 1913. Eventually, Greece and Great Britain pressured the Germans to support an agreement where the Ottomans would retain Tenedos, Kastelorizo and Imbros and the Greeks would control the other Aegean islands. The Greeks accepted the plan while the Ottoman Empire rejected the ceding of the other Aegean islands. This agreement would not hold, but the outbreak of World War I and the Turkish War of Independence put the issue to the side.
During the World War I Gallipoli Campaign, the British used the island as a supply base and built a 600m long airstrip for military operations.After the Turkish War of Independence ended in Greek defeat in Anatolia, and the fall of Lloyd George and his Middle Eastern policies, the western powers agreed to the Treaty of Lausanne with the new Turkish Republic, in 1923. This treaty made Tenedos and Imbros part of Turkey, and it guaranteed a special autonomous administrative status there to accommodate the local Greek population. The treaty excluded the Orthodox Christians on the islands from the population exchange that took place between Greece and Turkey. Article 14 of the treaty provided specific guarantees safeguarding the rights of minorities in both the nations.In 1912, when the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople conducted its own census, the population of the island was estimated to be: 5,420 Greeks and 1,200 Turks."
Tenedos,1922 and later,"Greece returned the island to Turkey in 1922. The inhabitants, substantially Greek Orthodox, were exempt from compulsory expulsion per the Lausanne Treaty's article 14, paragraph 2. Despite the treaty, the state of international relations between Greece and Turkey, wider world issues, and domestic pressures influenced how the Greek minority of Tenedos was treated. Acting reciprocally with Greece, Turkey made systematic attempts to evacuate the Greeks on the isle. Turkey never implemented either the Article 14 guarantee of some independence for the place in local rules, or the Article 39 guarantee to Turkish citizens, of all ethnicities, of the freedom to choose the language they wanted to use in their daily lives.In early 1926, conscripts and reservists of the army from Tenedos were transported to Anatolia. Great panic was engendered, and Greek youths fearing oppression fled the island. Others, who tried to hide in the mountains, were soon discovered and moved to Anatolia.Turkish law 1151 in 1927 specifically put administration of the islands in the hands of the Turkish government and not local populations, outlawed schooling in the Greek language and closed the Greek schools. According to the official Turkish census, in 1927 there were 2,500 Greeks and 1,247 Turks on the island.The Greco-Turkish rapprochement of 1930, which marks a significant turning point in the relations of the two countries, helped Tenedos reap some benefits too. In September 1933, moreover, certain islanders who had emigrated to America were allowed to return to and settle in their native land. Responding to the Greek good will over the straits, Turkey permitted the regular election of a local Greek mayor and seven village elders as well as a number of local employees.In the 1950s, tension between Greece and Turkey eased and law 1151/1927 was abolished and replaced by law no. 5713 in 1951, according to the law regular Greek language classes were added to the curriculum of the schools on Tenedos. Also, as restriction of travel to the island was relaxed, a growing number of Greek tourists from Istanbul and abroad visited Tenedos. These tourists did not only bring much needed additional revenues, but they also put an end to the twenty-seven-year long isolation of the islands from the outside world.However, when tensions increased in 1963 over Cyprus, the Turkish government again invoked a ban against Greek language education, and appropriated community property held by Greeks on the island. In 1964 Turkey closed the Greek-speaking schools on the island again. Furthermore, with the 1964 Law On Land Expropriation (No 6830) the farm property of the Greeks on the island was taken away from their owners. These policies, better economic options elsewhere, presence of a larger Greek community in Greece, fear and pressure, resulted in an exodus of the Greek population from the isle. The migrants retain Turkish citizenship but their descendants are not entitled to it. Greeks who left the island in the 1960s, often sold their properties, at particularly low prices, to their Turkish neighbours, which reflected the situation of duress under which they had to leave.In 1992, the Human Rights Watch report concluded that the Turkish government has denied the rights of the Greek community on Imbros and Tenedos in violation of the Lausanne Treaty and international human rights laws and agreements.In recent years there has been some progress in the relations between the different religious groups on the islands. In 2005, a joint Greek and Turkish delegation visited Tenedos and later that year Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan visited the island. After that visit, the Turkish government funded the restoration of the bell tower of the Orthodox Church in Tenedos (built originally in 1869). In 1925 the Orthodox church became part of the Metropolis of Imbros and Tenedos. Cyril Dragounis has been its bishop since 2002. In 2009, the Foundation of the Bozcaada Koimisis Theotokou Greek Orthodox Church won a judgement in the European Court of Human Rights for recognition and financial compensation over their degraded cemetery."
Tenedos,Turkish rule,"Turkey continued the old practice of exiling people to the island. The Democratic Party exiled Kemal Pilavoğlu, the leader of a religious sect, Ticani, to Tenedos for life, for sacrilege against Atatürk. Foreigners were prohibited from visiting the islands until the 1990s.  However, in the mid-1990s, the Turkish government financially supported the expansion of wineries and tourist opportunities on the island. Today the island is a growing summer tourist location for wine enthusiasts and others.Since 2011 an annual half marathon has been run on the island."
Tenedos,Proverbs of ancient Greeks regarding the island,"Greeks used the proverb ""Tenedian human"" (Ancient Greek: Τενέδιος ἄνθρωπος) in reference to those with frightening appearance, because when Tenes laid down laws at the island he stipulated that a man with an axe should stand behind the judge and strike the man being convicted after he had spoken in vain. 
In addition, they used the proverb ""Tenedian advocate"" (Ancient Greek: Τενέδιος συνήγορος), meaning a harsh advocate. There are many explanations regarding this proverb. Some say because the Tenedians honor two axes in their dedications. Aristotle said because a Tenedian king used to try lawsuits with an axe, so that he could execute wrongdoers on the spot, or because there was a place in Tenedos called Asserina, where there was a small river in which crabs have shell which was like an axe, or because a certain king laid down a law that adulterers should both be beheaded, and he observed this in the case of his son. Others said because of what Tenes suffered at the hands of his stepmother, he used to judge homicide suits with an axe."
Tenedos,Population,"In 1854, there were some 4,000 inhabitants on the island of Bozcaada, of which one-third were Turks. 
According to the Ottoman general census of 1893, the population of the island was divided as follows: 2,479 Greeks, 1,247 Turks, 103 Foreign Nationals and 6 Armenians.
In 1912, when the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople conducted its own census, the population of the island was estimated to be: 5,420 Greeks and 1,200 Turks.
In 1927, according to the official Turkish census, there were 2,500 Greeks and 1,247 Turks on the island.By 2000, the official count of ethnic Greeks permanently residing on the island had dropped to 22. In 2011 census Bozcaada's population was 2,472. During summer, many more visit the island, ballooning its population to over 10,000 people. Historically the Turkish mahalle (quarter) has been located to the south and the Greek one to the north. Each quarter has its own religious institutions, mosques on the Turkish side and churches on the Greek side. The Greek quarter was burned to the ground in the fire of 1874 and rebuilt, while the Turkish quarter has an older design. The houses are architecturally different in the two districts. The grid-planned Greek district has businesses, galleries and hotels. This district is dominated by the bell tower of the Church of the Dormition of the Mother of God. On 26 July every year, the Greeks gather here to eat, dance and celebrate the feast day of St. Paraskevi.The Turkish quarter has largely houses. The district, in its present version, dates to 1702, and contains the grave of a grand vizier, Halil Hamid Pasha. Pasha was executed on Tenedos after being exiled for scheming to replace sultan Abdülhamid I, with the ""șehzade"" (crown prince) Selim, the future Sultan. The grave is in the courtyard of the Alaybey Mosque, a historical monument. Another mosque, Köprülü Mehmet Paşa Mosque (also called Yali Mosque), is also a monument. The Turkish district, Alaybey, also has hammams and the Namazgah fountain.The island has native islanders from families who have lived on the island for centuries, new wealthy immigrants from Istanbul, and wage labor immigrants from mainland Anatolia, especially Romani people in Turkey from Bayramiç."
Tenedos,Economy,"Traditional economic activities are fishing and wine production. The remainder of arable land is covered by olive trees and wheat fields.  Most of the agriculture is done on the central plains and gentle hills of the island. Red poppies of the island are used to produce small quantities of sharbat and jam.  Sheep and goats are grazed at hilly northeastern and southeastern part of the island which is not suitable for agriculture. The number of farmers involved in grape cultivation has gone up from 210 to 397 in the recent years, though the farm area has gone down from 1,800 hectares (18 km2) to 1,200 hectares (12 km2).Tourism has been an important, but limited, economic activity since the 1970s but it developed rapidly from the 1990s onwards. The island's main attraction is the castle last rebuilt in 1815, illuminated at night, and with a view out to the open sea. The island's past is captured in a small museum, with a room dedicated to its Greek story. The town square boasts a ""morning market"" where fresh groceries and seafood are sold, along with the island's specialty of tomato jam. Mainlanders from Istanbul run some bars, boutiques and guesthouses.  In 2010, the island was named the world's second most-beautiful island by Condé Nast's Reader Choice award. The next year, the island topped the reader's list in the same magazine for the top 10 islands in Europe. In 2012, Condé Nast again selected Bozcaada as one of the 8 best islands in the world on account of its remnants of ancient buildings, less-crowded beaches, and places to stay.

Fishing plays a role in the island's economy, but similar to other Aegean islands, agriculture is a more significant economic activity. The local fishing industry is small, with the port authority counting 48 boats and 120 fishermen in 2011. Local fishing is year-round and seafood can be obtained in all seasons. The fish population has gone down over the years, resulting in a shrinking fishing industry, though increase in tourism and consequent demand for more seafood has benefited the industry. The sea off the island is one of the major routes by which fish in the Aegean sea migrate seasonally. During the migration period, boats from the outside come to the island for fishing.

In 2000, a wind farm of 17 turbines was erected at the western cape. It has a nominal power capacity of 10.2 MW energy, and produces 30 GWh of electricity every year. This is much more than what the island needs, and the excess is transferred to mainland Anatolia through an underground and partly undersea cable. Overhead cables and pylons were avoided for esthetic reasons, preserving the scenic view. The land has an average wind speed of 6.4 m/s and a mean energy density of 324 W/mat its meteorological station. This indicates significant wind energy generation potential.A United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) project, the International Centre for Hydrogen Energy Technologies (ICHET) set up an experimental renewables-hydrogen energy facility at the Bozcaada Governor's building on 7 October 2011. The project, supported by the Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR), is the first of its kind in the country. The power plant produces energy via a 20 kW solar photovoltaic array, and uses a 50 kW electrolyzer to store this energy as hydrogen. A fuel cell and hydrogen engine can convert this stored energy back into electricity when needed, and the experimental system can supply up to 20 households for a day.As of 2011, the town's hospital and governor's mansion were the only two buildings in the world using hydrogen energy. A boat and a golf cart are also powered by the same system. At the governor's place, energy is captured with a rooftop 20 Kw solar array and a 30 Kw wind mill. The electricity produced is used to electrolyze water into hydrogen. This gas is stored compressed, and can be used later to generate energy or as fuel in hydrogen-powered cars.  In June 2011, Henry Puna, the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands traveled to Tenedos to investigate how the island uses hydrogen energy.In 2012, the Turkish government opened a customs office on the island, possibly opening the way for future direct travel between Greek ports and the island."
Tenedos,Wine production,"The island is windy throughout the year and this makes the climate dry and warm enough to grow grapes. In classical antiquity wine production was linked with the cult of Dionysus, while grapes were also depicted in the local currency. The local wine culture outlived the Ottoman period. Vineyards have existed on the island since antiquity and today occupy one-third of the total land of the island and 80% of its agricultural land, In the mid-1800s, the island exported 800,000 barrels of wine annually and was revered as the best wine in the Eastern Mediterranean. Ottoman traveler Evliya Çelebi wrote in the 16th century that the finest wines in the world were being produced in Tenedos. Today, the island is one of the major wine producing areas in Turkey and grows four local strains of grape: Çavuş, Karasakız (Kuntra), Altınbaş (Vasilaki), and Karalahna. However, in recent years traditional French varieties have increased in prominence, namely Cabernet Sauvignon.Prior to 1923, wine production on the island was exclusively done by the Greek population; however, after this point, Turkish domestic wine production increased and Greeks on the island taught the Turkish population how to manufacture wine. By 1980, there were 13 wine production plants on the island. High taxes caused many of these to go out of business until 2001 when the state decreased taxes on wine and subsidized some of the producers on the island. In recent years, newer producers have relied upon Italian and French experts to improve production. In 2010, the island produced a record 5,000 tons of wine. Corvus has introduced modern wine making techniques to Tenedos. Grape harvest festivities are held the first week of September annually."
Tenedos,Transportation,"The main transportation from mainland Turkey is by ferries from Geyikli and from the town of Çanakkale. The island is roughly 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) from mainland Turkey. From the Geyikli pier, ferry travel is available for both passengers and automobiles, and takes about 35 minutes.  A passenger-only ferry service from Çanakkale began running in 2009.  Both run less often during the winter months. The island is seven hours by bus and then ferry from Istanbul. In 2012, Seabird Airlines began offering flights from Istanbul's Golden Horn to the island."
Tenedos,Culture,"The Turkish film Akıllı Köpek Max (Max the Smart Dog) was filmed in Bozcaada in 2012. Another Turkish film, Bi Küçük Eylül Meselesi (A Small September Affair) was filmed on the island in 2013."

German Clock Museum,About the museum,"The German Clock Museum is devoted to the history of timekeeping devices. A major focus is on clockmaking in the Black Forest, both as a cottage industry and on an industrial scale. The museum has an extensive collection of clocks and other artefacts relating to horology, not just those from the Black Forest, but also clocks and watches from around the world and spanning from prehistoric times to the present. The collection includes early cuckoo clocks from the 18th century as well as the prototypes of the modern Black Forest souvenir. The work of Robert Gerwig formed a primary basis of the museum."
German Clock Museum,Chronology,"1852: Robert Gerwig, Director of the Grand Ducal Baden Clockmaking School in Furtwangen, began to collect old clocks as witnesses of traditional handicrafts.
1858: The collection is exhibited for the first time at the Black Forest Industry Exhibition in Villingen.
1874: Historical clocks together with contemporary products of the region are put on display in the newly built trade hall.
1925: The first printed collection catalogue of the Adolf Kistner Historical Clock Collection already lists over 1,000 clocks.
1959: A new building is opened on the site of the old wooden building that had fallen into decay.
1975: The state of Baden-Württemberg purchases the important clock collection from the Kienzle clock factories and transfers it to the museum. Due to the expansion of its collection to include pocket watches and Renaissance clocks, the ""Historic Clock Collection"" is renamed in 1978 to the ""German Clock Museum"".

1992: The current museum building is opened. Today, the German Clock Museum is part of Furtwangen University."
German Clock Museum,Exhibits,"Since 2010, the museum has put on a permanent exhibition, covering an area of 1,400 square metres, of the development of clocks and the concept of timekeeping in Western countries. In addition to improvements in the accuracy of timepieces, it also demonstrates the various requirements that clocks and watches met in order to satisfy the needs of the time. Thus, in addition to prize exhibits, the museum also displays objects that, despite their low value, were historically very important. This distinguishes the German Clock Museum from clock collections that display objects that were rather rare and expensive compared with those in typical everyday use.
The circular tour is divided into the sections covering the following themes: 

History of Clocks and Time up to Industrialisation;
Black Forest Clocks;
Pocket Watches and Wristwatches;
Modern Times and Mechanical Musical Instruments."
German Clock Museum,History of Clocks and Time up to Industrialisation,"Until well into the 20th century, clocks were based on the (apparent) course of the sun and the stars in the sky. This connexion is clearly built into the works of the priest-mechanics of the 18th century with their clockwork models of the cosmos.
In addition to the astronomic calendar clock of Benedictine father and later mathematics professor, Thaddäus Rinderle, of 1787 (Inv. 16-0033), the Copernican Planetarium (Inv. 43-0002, 1774) and a globe clock (Globenuhr, Inv. 43-0001, before 1788) by Philipp Matthäus Hahn are part of the collection.

Selected examples"
German Clock Museum,Wooden clocks from the Black Forest,"In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Black Forest supplied the world with low cost clocks. In many small clockmaking workshops, clocks with wooden movements were made which, thanks to the cheap raw material, the use of special tools and machines and specialised craftsmen, were inexpensive and faced no real competition.
A wooden clock face with a white background and colourfully painted motif decorated the Black Forest clocks during the whole of the 19th century. With a colourless, protective varnish the clock faces were resistant to moisture and dirt. From the second half of the 18th century, the varnished plate clock (Lackschilduhr) dominated the European market. Later, it found its way overseas and to the Far East. The design of the clock plate varied depending on the country being exported to. Black Forest traders, the clock carriers (Uhrenträger), sold the clocks locally.

Selected examples"
German Clock Museum,Clock industry in the Black Forest,"In the second half of the 19th century, clock factories displaced the traditional manufacture of clockmaking in the home. Initially relatively small firms emerged that specialised in the production of short runs of qualitatively high value clocks based on the traditional prototype. Over time the factories that became successful were those, especially in the Württemberg (eastern) half of the Black Forest and neighbouring Baar region, that embraced new types of clock, like alarm clocks, that were suited to industrial processes. In most households there was a clock suited to each room, from the alarm clock to the kitchen clock to the sideboard or wall clock.

Selected examples"
German Clock Museum,Pocket watches,"In the 16th and 17th centuries the sometimes voluminous neck clocks (Halsuhren) were more of an expensive piece of jewellery than an accurate timepiece. Not until the time around 1800 were the first pocket watches available for the landed gentry and for science, but at best they displayed minutes. As a result of industrial manufacturing in the second half of the 19th century, however, the pocket watch became an everyday item.

Selected examples"
German Clock Museum,Highlights,"Among the highlights of its permanent exhibits are:

German Clock Museum,Tourism and visitors,"Around one third of visitors book a personal guided tour during which clocks and musical instruments are set in motion. Especially during the holidays children may build and decorate a clock in the ""clock workshop"". For school classes, the museum offers themed workshops in modules, some of which are designed to match the education syllabus. The collection has 8,000 items and about 1,300 clocks are permanently displayed. As well as clocks, the collection includes a company documents archive and a specialist library of German-language literature.
In 2006, the museum was one of 365 places selected to represent Germany in the federal chancellor's competition Land of Ideas. In 2008, the museum was awarded the distinction of being an ""anchor point on the European Route of Industrial Heritage"". At the same time, the museum became a milestone on the German Clock Road that links places in the region associated with clockmaking.
In 2010, the museum had 60,000 visitors."

Space Engine Systems,Company history,"Space Engines Systems Inc. was established in 2012 to develop the DASS engine and related technologies in the aerospace sector. Space Engine Systems's promoters have been involved in the development of the engine for over 20 years. SES and CAN-K>CAN-K Main Page</ref> work together to bring novel pumps, compressors, and gearbox systems to the aerospace industry as spin off applications. On May 10, 2012, SES publicly announced the launch of their company at the Farnborough Air Show (July 9–15, 2012).  On August 6, they announced their participation in the AUVSI's Unmanned Systems North America. SES frequently attends major international trade shows in the aerospace sector including the Paris Air Show in 2013, 2015, and 2017 and the Farnborough Air Show in 2014 and 2016."
Space Engine Systems,DASS engine,"The DASS engine is a pre-cooled combined cycle propulsion concept that can produce thrust over a wide range of vehicle flight Mach numbers (rest to hypersonic). Derivatives of the engine can be used for propulsion of an SSTO vehicle, long-range missiles, and hypersonic transport aircraft. The engine is being developed with the flexibility for various vehicles and mission profiles. The concept uses existing aerospace technologies, including conventional gas turbine components, and new developments in nanotechnology to overcome some of the key technical obstacles associated with overheating and fuel storage. In high-speed flight, the incoming air has a very high dynamic pressure and aerodynamic deceleration results in a rise in static pressure and temperature. Temperatures can rise above the material limits of the compressor blades in a conventional turbojet. A strategy to alleviate this problem is to place a heat exchanger downstream of the inlet in order to reduce gas temperatures prior to mechanical compression. Similar to the deep-cooled turbojet or the liquefied air cycle engine (LACE), energy extracted from the incoming air in the DASS engine is added back into the system downstream as sensible heat in the fuel stream.
The DASS engine concept improves upon the heat exchange process in multiple ways. Surface nano-coatings are placed on the internal heat exchangers to enhance convective heat transfer rates, reduce heat exchanger mass, and reduce unwanted aerodynamic blockage. Metallic nanoparticles are seeded into the intake air from the inlet cone to further enhance heat transfer. The particles act as a supplemental fuel and assist the operation of flow control devices downstream. It is known that metallic fuels have desirable storage properties in comparison to hydrogen and have excellent energy densities on a per volume basis. A combination of hydrogen and nanoparticles of Boron are being considered as the engine's fuel.
The main advantage of the DASS engine over conventional rocket engines for high-speed flight is the use of atmospheric oxygen in its air-breathing mode. The specific impulse (Isp) of air-breathing engines are superior to rockets over a wide range of Mach numbers. These gains have the potential to realize a larger payload mass fraction (e.g. 4% for NASP to LEO vs 2.6% for Soyuz-2 to LEO). The higher Isp associated with air-breathing engines is a major motivation for the development of supersonic combustion ramjet engines. Airbreathing engines typically have a lower thrust-to-weight ratio compared to rockets. That is why the DASS engine will be integrated into a lifting-body vehicle. For an SSTO vehicle, reduced vehicle mass and increased payload mass fraction translates to lower operation costs. For transport, the ability to travel at hypersonic speeds drastically decreases the time required to cover long distances. The altitude at which hypersonic cruise vehicles operate is usually much higher than conventional transporters (30 km for A2 vs 13.1 km for A380). The lower air density at these higher altitudes reduces the overall vehicle drag, which further improves efficiency. Current research and development is focused on engine operation at Mach 5 cruise at an altitude of 30 km. Note that 30 km is still significantly lower than what is considered to be the edge of space (100 km) and much lower than low Earth orbit (~200 km). Therefore, for the DASS Engine to operate beyond the target 30 km and Mach 5 operating conditions, the design will be modified. At higher altitudes the air density decreases and the vehicle must travel faster to achieve a sufficient inlet mass capture. At even higher altitudes, the DASS engine will need to store onboard oxidizer to be used with a rocket motor in its flow path. The target is to achieve a major component of orbital velocity when operating in the airbreathing mode before switching to the rocket mode."
Space Engine Systems,Engine details,"At low flight speeds the DASS engine relies solely on the on-board turbojet that runs on a conventional hydrocarbon fuel. The variable geometry intake (PCT patent pending) allows large gaps to form between the heat exchanger (which is not operating at this stage), minimizing intake pressure losses. During this mode, the bypass is closed and all air is processed through the turbojet core. The exhaust nozzle (PCT patent pending) contracts in the subsonic mode for optimal specific thrust. As the engine accelerates to supersonic velocities, the articulated portions of the intake direct flow into the heat exchanger (PCT patent pending). Liquid hydrogen fuel is passed through the heat exchanger, decreasing the temperature of the air prior to engine compression. Some of the air bypass the turbojet core, and is mixed with the hydrogen exiting the heat exchanger in the afterburner section. Note that the magnitude of heat transfer is coupled to the amount of hydrogen available for combustion in the afterburner. The combustion products are then expanded through a supersonic nozzle, variable geometry nozzle. The engine will be designed to completely consume the air to optimize for thrust. The level of bypass changes throughout the supersonic flight regime. The engine can operate at Mach 4 and provide thrust in excess of a conventional ramjet. At high Mach numbers (~4.88) air cannot be cooled below the turbojet limit (1200K). As a result, no combustion can occur in the core turbojet and the engine must transition into a pure ramjet mode. The variable inlet continues to articulate (PCT patent pending) to completely block air access to the turbojet, while optimizing intake to exit area ratios for ramjet combustion using hydrogen. The engine still realizes an efficiency boost from the cooling effects of the heat exchanger (albeit much less in this mode). The terminal flight speed is limited to that of a hydrogen fueled ramjet.
The goals of the DASS GN X and DASS GN1 engines are to provide efficient thrust from rest up to hypersonic speeds (M~5) and high altitudes (h~30 km) with a low specific fuel consumption along the entire flight path, and a small rocket stage to bring the vehicle into orbit. The engine will operate on multiple fuels (hydrogen, hydrocarbons, and metallic fuels). Each type of fuel has an advantage. The hydrocarbon fuel is typically used in turbojet/turbofan engines, which are considered mature/conventional technology. This engine will provide thrust at low-speeds. Hydrogen has a large heat capacity (~14 kJ/kgK), so it is an excellent heat sink for the heat exchanger (patent pending). It also has the best energy content per unit mass of any fuel and is a light molecule. As a result, it can provide large thrust levels with a low specific fuel consumption. Metallic fuel has excellent storage qualities, high energy content per unit volume, and can assist in convective heat transfer. It also has good combustion properties at nano-scale.
Key technology components of the DASS GN 1 and DASS GN X are quite similar. The DASS GN1 is meant exclusively for aerospace and the DASS GN X is meant for space applications only. An engine prototype is planned for ground and flight testing."
Space Engine Systems,Engine comparison,"The table below shows a comparison of the DASS engine to more conventional high-speed engines (Ramjet) at two Mach numbers. Two types of Ramjets were considered. The first Ramjet uses a combination of fuels (Kerosene and hydrogen) in similar proportions as the DASS engine. The second Ramjet uses pure hydrogen. It is clear that at the lower Mach number, the DASS engine provides a higher specific thrust. This is due to higher pressure that can be utilized by the turbojet. At Mach 4 the DASS GN1 performs similarly to a ramjet. At this speed, the DASS GN1 engine would likely convert to a pure ramjet. The specifications listed do not include any gains that might be realized through heat transfer on the intake cone (PCT patent pending), or from the combustion of metallic fuel. A typical rocket specific impulse is between 250 – 500 seconds."
Space Engine Systems,Ground Testing Facility,"Space Engine Systems is developing a ground testing facility capable of simulating high temperature inlet flow at high altitudes associated with supersonic flight. The facility, named the Multi-Fuel Jet Engine testing facility, is highly modular and can easily be adapted for many applications. The facility includes:
• Direct Connect System to supply high temperature air flow to the engine to simulate supersonic air flow up to Mach 5.
• Fuel System to supply multiple fuels to the engine, including liquid hydrogen, jet fuel, and solid nano-particles.
• Measurement Suite to allow data collection and analysis of all tested equipment.
The Multi-Fuel Jet Engine testing facility can be used to better understand:
• Pre-cooled combined cycle propulsion
• Temperature limitations of various turbine engine materials/components
• Multi-fuel combustion (conventional, solid, and rocket fuels)
• Multi-fuel afterburners
• Engine start modes at high altitude
• Thrust characteristics at high altitude
• By-pass ratio control
• Engine test-stand and mounting mechanisms
• Flow characteristics"
Space Engine Systems,Incorporation of nanotechnology,"One of the main challenges is to develop a technique to inject the nano-particles in a manner which promotes homogeneous mixing. Second, characterize the heat transfer properties of the flow mixture.
Only a small amount of nanoparticles are required to provide the heat transfer gains required by the engine. It was found that even with very small mass loadings (0.1%), large gains in heat transfer can be achieved (40%). Therefore, it is feasible to use the available hydrogen as a carrier for the particles. Care must be taken to ensure that the hydrogen content stays below the lean flammability limit to prevent uncontrolled ignition before reaching the combustor. A 1:1 mass ratio mixture of nanoparticles and hydrogen will be injected into freestream to achieve 0.1% mass loading of nanoparticles and hydrogen in air. The injected mixture will cool the freestream air such that a gain in stagnation pressure is realized as the flow decelerates inside of the engine. Not only does heat transfer occur from the particles to the air, heat transfer will also occur along in the intake cone surface.
Some nanoparticles outperform hydrogen (per unit volume) and hydrocarbons (per unit mass and volume) in terms of energy storage. Two important metrics are the energy per unit mass and energy per unit volume. Vehicles are usually designed on a per unit volume basis (for drag considerations). On a per unit volume basis, Boron outperforms both hydrogen and hydrocarbons. On a per unit mass basis, Boron outperforms hydrocarbon fuels but is not as good as hydrogen. Therefore, the DASS engines will take advantage of the excellent properties of Boron along with hydrocarbon, and hydrogen fuels."
Space Engine Systems,Heat exchanger,The proposed structure of the heat exchanger is a nano-porous foam. The foam will strengthen the nano-porous structure while maximizing the heat transfer and minimizing the pressure drop. This in combination with the added effect of nano-particle dispersion should allow for a smaller heat exchanger.
Space Engine Systems,Research,"Major technology hurdles for the DASS engine are related to the implementation of nanotechnology in the engine components. In a partnership with the University of Calgary, SES will assess the feasibility of using surface nano-coatings on the heat exchangers, study the effect of nanoparticle suspensions on convective heat transfer, and assess the feasibility of using metallic nanoparticles as a supplemental fuel. The Canadian Government (through NSERC funding) is also a partner in the DASS Engine project."
Space Engine Systems,Surface nano-coatings on heat exchangers,"Coating a solid body with nano-particles has been shown in the scientific literature to enhance the convective heat transfer rate from solid bodies. Several mechanisms have been proposed, including the increase in the overall surface area associated with nano-coating. Essentially, it is possible that the nanoparticles act as small scale fins, which are known to improve heat exchanger effectiveness. Since these nano-scale fins are small, the pressure drop is also much less than when compared to the pressure losses of a large scale fin. This reduces the work requirements in pumping or compressing the fluid as it passes through the heat exchanger. The presence of surface roughness associated with nanoparticle deposits also promotes mixing, which directly affects convective heat transfer."
Space Engine Systems,Nanoparticle suspensions for heat transfer,"The suspension of a large amount of small scale solid particles in a gas results in a large surface-area-to-volume ratio. Studies in the scientific literature have shown that there is a unique interaction between the properties of solid nanoparticles and those of carrier fluid. The end result, which is not observed with larger scale particles (i.e. micron), is the alteration of the properties of the bulk fluid. For example, Lee et al. (1999) and Wang et al. (1999) have shown, experimentally, that the suspension of 24 and 23 nm diameter CuO particles in water enhance the thermal conductivity of water by 34%. SES will investigate the potential enhancement of the thermal conductivity of gases with suspended nanoparticles."
Space Engine Systems,Nanoparticle combustion,"Metal powders have been considered as alternative fuels for air-breathing engines because of their large energy content per unit mass and per unit volume in comparison to liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Although hydrogen has a larger energy content per unit mass than metal fuels, hydrogen fuel needs to be stored at very high pressures, cooled cryogenically, or absorbed in other materials in order to accumulate a practical amount of mass. In contrast, metal particles can be packed and stored efficiently and safely. Since the overall rate of combustion is proportional to surface area, the use of smaller scale particles can improve combustion and increase engine performance. It has been found that nanoparticles typically have a lower melting point, ignite at lower temperatures, and have a higher burning rate than larger scale particles. Therefore, the use of a particle fuel or a particle supplement to a conventional fuel is being considered in SES's new aero-engine design."

Willie King,Biography,"King was born in Prairie Point, a community in Noxubee County, Mississippi near the Alabama border. Prior to recording, he worked as a sharecropper, moonshine maker and traveling salesman; just a few of his many occupations. Later he became active with the civil rights movement, which inspired him to write socially conscious blues songs. In 1983, he founded the Rural Members Association, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the traditional rural skills King had grown up with, which he called 'survival skills,' and helping improve his local community.  In 1997, the Rural Members Association started the annual Freedom Creek blues festival, which has since received international recognition. He began recording in 1999 and his 2000 recordings Freedom Creek and I Am The Blues, were the first of several acclaimed albums.
King performed at national and international festivals but mostly played near his home, most notably as a regular at Bettie's Juke joint in Mississippi. He described his music as ""struggling blues"" because of its focus on the ""injustices in life in the rural South"".King died from a heart attack shortly before his 66th birthday, near his home in the rural community of Old Memphis, Alabama, just a few miles from his birthplace."
Willie King,Willie King on film,"Dutch film-makers Saskia Rietmeijer and Bart Drolenga (Visible World Films) wanted to produce a documentary about African American arts and culture in the Deep South. But they met Willie King and instead decided to devote their efforts to creating a documentary about King's life and times, titled Down in the Woods.  King was also featured in Martin Scorsese's 2003 documentary series The Blues and Shout Factory's Blues Story the same year."

Betsy Ross House,Restoration,"Over the years, various structural changes and general wear and tear left the house in dire need of restoration. In 1937, Philadelphia radio mogul, A. Atwater Kent offered up to $25,000 for the restoration of the house and commissioned historical architect Richardson Brognard Okie to do the work. Original elements were kept wherever possible. Otherwise, materials from demolished period homes were used. A new structure was added in the rear, made from period bricks. The front stairway and dormer were entirely replaced. The front doorway was moved to the opposite corner, and a new window was installed. Kent then purchased the two adjacent properties to develop a ""civic garden."" In 1941, the entire property, including the historic house and courtyard, were given to the city of Philadelphia. In 1965 an annex building was added to the property, and in 1974 the courtyard was renovated and a fountain added.
In preparation for the United States Bicentennial, remains deemed to be those of Ross and her third husband, John Claypoole, were moved to graves in the courtyard. A private nonprofit organization, Historic Philadelphia, Inc., began leasing the property from the City of Philadelphia in 1995 and continues to manage the site to this day.

The Betsy Ross House has long been the site of Philadelphia's observance of Flag Day."

Bobby Murcer,Early life,"Murcer played on the football, baseball, and basketball teams as a sophomore at Southeast High School in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In his junior year, he made the All-district football team. He also helped Southeast High to the conference championship in baseball. As a senior, Murcer showed his athletic abilities by making All-State in both football (the state leading scorer) and baseball and was All-City (led the city in scoring) in basketball and baseball. As a senior Murcer hit .458 and struck out only once. Later, in the winter of 1964, he signed a letter of intent to play for the Oklahoma Sooners, but in the spring of 1965 he signed a $20,000 ($171,975 today) bonus contract with the Yankees."
Bobby Murcer,Minor league career (1964–68),"Murcer signed a contract with Yankees' scout Tom Greenwade, the same scout who signed fellow Oklahoman Mickey Mantle (Murcer's baseball hero). Murcer signed for a $10,000 bonus in June 1964. He began with the Johnson City, rookie-level Appalachian League club in 1964 and hit .365 in 126 at bats.
The following season, 1965, he was the Carolina League MVP with the Greensboro (N.C.) Yankees, a Single-A affiliate). Murcer hit .322, homered 16 times, drove in 90 runs, and stole 18 bases, playing in his league's All-Star game that season. In 1966, he began the season with the Yankees, but was sent down to Toledo of the International League. There he was in the All-Star game once again. He hit .266 with 15 home runs and had 63 RBIs to go along with 16 steals.
While on leave from the United States Army in 1968, Murcer played seven games in the Fall Instructional League. After his discharge, he played third base for Caguas in the Puerto Rico League, where he drove in 18 runs in 22 games.
When Major League Baseball expanded from 20 to 24 teams prior to the 1969 season, the Yankees allegedly protected Murcer and Jerry Kenney from the 1968 MLB expansion draft by making a last-minute appeal to other owners to allow players that were fulfilling their military obligation to be exempt from the expansion draft, which allowed the Yankees to protect 17 players instead of 15. The Yankees devised this strategy specifically to protect Murcer, who spent 1967 and 1968 in the Army.
Playing in the minor leagues from 1964–66, Murcer hit .302 which does not include his 1–12 stint with the Ft. Lauderdale Yankees in 1985 when he was attempting a comeback to the Yankees or his time with the Instructional League and the Puerto Rico League in 1968."
Bobby Murcer,Major league career,
Bobby Murcer,"New York Yankees (1965–66, 1969–74)","A shortstop in the minor leagues, Murcer was slated to play the position for the Yankees but ended up being a center fielder, following in the footsteps of Mickey Mantle and Joe DiMaggio, and there were strong expectations that he would be ""the next Mantle"". Murcer became one of the team's most popular players of the era.
His first hit in the major leagues, in 1965, was a game-winning home run. He also played on ""Mickey Mantle Day"" on September 18 of that year. Murcer said playing alongside Mantle in that game was the ""greatest thrill of his career"". He began the 1966 season with the major league club but was sent down to Triple-A. Murcer then spent 1967–68 in the United States Army as a result of the escalation of the Vietnam War.
After returning from the Army, Murcer began the 1969 season hitting .321, with 11 homers and a league-leading 43 runs-batted-in, when he jammed his heel in Kansas City. Murcer recalled, ""I laid out seven days, and I lost my groove and my momentum"". He ended the season batting .259 with 26 homers and playing center field, his third defensive position, after beginning the season at third base and then switching to right field. On August 10, 1969, he was part of a feat that was perhaps the highlight of the 1969 season for Yankees' fans. Murcer, Thurman Munson, and Gene Michael hit consecutive home runs in the sixth inning against Oakland. Murcer led off the inning with a shot into the right-field bleachers. Munson, playing in only his second major league game, hit a pitch into the left-field seats, bringing up Michael, who hit a ball into the right-field seats. This was the third time Yankees hit three successive home runs. Bobby Richardson, Mickey Mantle, and Joe Pepitone did it in 1966. In 1947 Charlie Keller, Joe DiMaggio, and Johnny Lindell accomplished the feat.

Murcer tied for the American League (AL) lead in outfield assists in 1970 with 15, while committing only 3 errors in center field. In June 1970, Murcer hit home runs in four consecutive at-bats in a doubleheader against the Cleveland Indians, tying an American League record and joining Lou Gehrig, Johnny Blanchard, and Mickey Mantle as the only Yankees to hit home runs in four consecutive at-bats. Murcer's reported salary for both 1969 and 1970 was $27,500.In 1971, Murcer earned a raise to $35,000 and he ended the 1971 season with a career-high .331 batting average, good for second in the AL. He led the American League in on-base percentage (.427) and times on base (266), and came in second in slugging percentage (.543) and runs (94), fourth in RBIs (94) and walks (91), fifth in intentional walks (13), and tenth in home runs (25). Murcer was seventh in MVP voting and was voted to the Sporting News All-Star team. Additionally, Murcer was Second-team All-MLB by both the Associated Press and the Newspaper Enterprise Association. On July 25, Murcer hit a pinch-hit grand slam in a win against the Milwaukee Brewers, the first of his seven career grand slams.
In 1972, with a new $65,000 salary, Murcer recorded a career-high 30 doubles (third in the AL), 7 triples (fourth), 33 home runs (second), and 96 RBIs (third). He also led the AL in runs scored (102), extra-base hits (70), and total bases (314), was third in slugging percentage (.537) and hits (171), and 10th in batting (.292). He came in fifth in the AL MVP voting and won a Gold Glove for his fielding. Murcer was fourth in the AL in fielding percentage (.992) led the league in putouts (382), and was third in outfield assists with eleven. On August 29,  Murcer hit for the cycle. On June 3, Murcer's five runs scored in a game marked the 11th time it had been done in Yankee history. He was named to the Sporting News All-Star team again and Murcer's 33 home runs were the most by a Yankee centerfielder since Mickey Mantle hit 35 in 1964. No Yankee center fielder topped that mark until 2011 when Curtis Granderson hit 41. Again he was named to The Sporting News AL All-Star team and was Second-team All-MLB by both the AP and NEA.
On March 6, 1973, Murcer asked for and received a $100,000 salary for the upcoming season, making him only the third Yankee to make six figures. For that season Murcer was third in the league in hits (187), fourth in batting (.301), and seventh in RBIs (95). He was ninth in the MVP voting. He also led the American League in assists for the second time in four years, with 14. He made the Sporting News All-Star team for the third time in his career and for the third time in three seasons he was Second-team All-MLB by both the AP and NEA. He narrowly missed his second Gold Glove, finishing fourth in the voting among American League outfielders. He finished with 17 game-winning hits, second to AL MVP Reggie Jackson's 18. On July 13,  Murcer hit three home runs for the second time in his career and drove in all five runs in a 5–0 win over the Kansas City Royals.
On June 30, 1973, baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn fined Murcer $250 for saying that Kuhn didn't have the ""guts"" to stop Hall of Fame pitcher Gaylord Perry from throwing the spitball. That night, Murcer hit a two-run homer off Perry that put the Yankees ahead in a 7–2 victory over the Cleveland Indians. Murcer had made his original comment about Kuhn after Perry beat New York the previous week, which ended the Yankees' eight-game winning streak. Kuhn said Murcer apologized in their meeting but Murcer refused to tell newsmen that he had, and he ""didn't sound too contrite"". Murcer, who flung his right hand into the air when he rounded first after hitting the homer, said to reporters ""I hit a hanging spitter.""
For his career, Murcer hit Perry at a .232 clip with two home runs in 69 at-bats. However, much of that low batting average was due to the 2 for 20 performance in the 1972 season, which caused Murcer's ire in the first place. Aside from the abysmal 1972 summer, he had against Perry, who won the A.L. Cy Young Award that year, Murcer hit .286 against him.
Murcer also had some fun with Perry; he once caught a fly for the last out of an inning and spit on the ball before tossing it to him. Another time he sent Perry a gallon of lard. Perry retaliated by having a mutual acquaintance cover his hand with grease before shaking hands with Murcer and saying ""Gaylord says hello.""In early 1974, Murcer and Mickey Mantle flew to Washington, D.C. to visit with Senator Ted Kennedy's son, Teddy, whose right leg had recently been amputated due to cancer. Murcer and Mantle traveled at Senator Kennedy's request and George Steinbrenner's expense.
Murcer, who had hit 25 homers with regularity, found it hard to hit home runs at Shea Stadium, where the Yankees played in 1974 and 1975 while Yankee Stadium was renovated. In the 1974 season, Murcer hit only two home runs at Shea, on consecutive days, (September 21 and 22, 1974).
In 1974 Murcer led all major league outfielders in assists by throwing out 21 baserunners. He was second in the AL in sacrifice flies (12), seventh in RBIs (88), and ninth in intentional walks (10), and was an American League All-Star for the brought consecutive season and was the highest-paid player in Yankee history, earning $120,000."
Bobby Murcer,San Francisco Giants (1975–76),"Murcer was traded to the San Francisco Giants for Bobby Bonds in 1975 in baseball's first even swap of $100,000 superstar players. In October the Yankees were looking for a quality starter and a righthanded power man. Early on October 22, Gabe Paul called Murcer to say he had been traded straight up to San Francisco for Bobby Bonds. ""The trade came"", he remembered, ""just after I had told Gabe I could finally accept right field if I knew I would be a Yankee the rest of my career. He said there was no way the Yankees could trade me. Three days later, I was gone.""In 1975, wearing uniform #20, Murcer led the National League in sacrifice flies with 12 and was 5th in walks with 91 drove in 91 runs, and batted .298. He also led the Giants in game-winning hits with 13. Additionally, he was fourth among NL right fielders in fielding percentage with .981. On May 24, 1975, Murcer went 2 for 3 with a triple and a home run and had a career-high 6 RBIs in a win over the Cubs. That week he won the first of two National League Player of the Week awards. (He won the second two weeks later when he hit .483 for the week, including one home run and seven RBI). He played in his fifth All-Star game and was Second-team All-National League by United Press International.
However, despite a fine offensive season, he hit only 11 home runs, eliciting this quote from Murcer, ""Patty Hearst could be hiding in Candlestick's upper deck and nobody would ever find her"", referring to how tough it was to hit long balls at the park where the Giants played their home games. Author Zander Hollander noted that season that ""only Murcer's dwindling power keeps him from superstar status"" since other than the lack of home runs Murcer had a fine year in his first season as a Giant.
On April 6, 1976, the Associated Press reported that Murcer signed for a reported  $175,000, making him the highest-paid player in Giants history and gave him about a $25,000 raise over his 1975 salary. That season Murcer regained his power swing and was 6th in the NL with 23 home runs, and 7th in RBIs (90). He walked 84 times which was sixth in the NL. He was also voted the Giants MVP after leading the Giants in home runs and tied for the team lead in steals with 12 and was second on the club with 10 game-winning RBI. His two consecutive seasons with 90 or more RBIs was not duplicated by a San Francisco Giant until Will Clark did it in 1987–88.
On May 26, 1976, Murcer hit a grand slam against the Astros and on September 22, 1976, he stole home in a 3–1 victory against the rival Dodgers and a week later, on September 29, 1976, he gloved the final out in John Montefusco's no-hitter."
Bobby Murcer,Chicago Cubs (1977–79),"He was dealt along with Steve Ontiveros and minor-league right-handed pitcher Andy Muhlstock from the Giants to the Cubs for Bill Madlock and Rob Sperring on February 11, 1977. On March 6, 1977, Murcer signed his first-ever multi-year deal, calling for $1.6 million over five seasons. The contract made him the highest-paid Cub player in history. In the span of four years, Murcer held that distinction for three franchises, the Yankees, Giants and Cubs. As a tribute to Mantle, Murcer wore #7 with the Cubs.
That year he led the league with ten sacrifice flies and was eighth in intentional walks (13) while hitting 27 home runs and driving in 89 runs which led the team. Murcer also tied for the team lead (with Bill Buckner) in game-winning hits with nine. His 16 steals were second on the club and he drew 80 bases on balls, good for 9th in the NL. Also, Murcer was third among all NL right-fielders in assists. He was voted to the UPI All-National League team making it six times in seven seasons he received some kind of post-season honor by a national press organization. On June 29, 1977, in his return to Candlestick Park, Murcer drove in 6 runs (matching his career-high) in a 10–9 win over the Giants. On September 26, 1977, Murcer hit the 200th home run of his career, off future broadcast partner Jim Kaat.On August 8, 1977, Murcer promised to try to hit a home run and a double for terminally ill fan Scott Crull whom he had spoken to by phone. That night, against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Murcer hit two home runs. Broadcasting the game nationally on ABC, Keith Jackson told the country how Murcer had fulfilled the dying boy's last wish. However, no one had told the young man he was dying. Murcer, however, denied he made an outright promise to Crull, as ABC had reported during the game.Scott's mother told the AP, ""It's wonderful that he got to talk to one of the players, and by Murcer hitting the home runs...he was thrilled."" The AP later reported comments from Kenneth Crull, the young boy's uncle, that ""Bobby Murcer did a wonderful thing for Scotty . . . it was the highlight of his whole life."" Linda Crull, the boy's aunt, added, ""What Bobby Murcer did was great. But what happened afterward we'd just as soon forget about."" ABC's Jackson had relayed the story that had been told to him by a Chicago Cub official Buck Peden and alerted the boy to his own medical condition. Three weeks later, on August 22, Crull died. Ten hours later the Cubs beat the Giants 3–2 at Wrigley Field and Murcer hit his 24th home run. At that point, the Cubs' record was 70–53, and they were 7+1⁄2 games out, in second place. The Cubs slumped and finished at .500 with an 81–81 record. The homer in the August 22, 1977, ""Scott Crull"" game was one of 5 game-winning home runs Murcer had in 1977.In 1978 he was eighth in the league with 15 intentional walks and walked a total of 80 times, which was ninth in the NL for the second time in a row. He also had one stretch of eight straight hits, a feat not duplicated by a Cub until Andre Dawson did it in 1989. Previously only Billy Williams, in 1972, was the only Chicago Cub to perform that feat. Murcer is one of seven Cubs to have three multiple intentional-walk games since 1960, joining Ernie Banks, Sammy Sosa, Billy Williams, Don Kessinger, Derek Lee, and Andre Dawson. Murcer, on April 25, 1978, hit a grand slam off Steve Carlton in a 4–2 win versus the Philadelphia Phillies. On September 10, 1978, Murcer went 5 for 5, the only 5-hit game of his career.
During 4+1⁄2 seasons in the National League, Murcer was particularly rough on the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 63 games against them Murcer hit .347 with 11 homers and had a slugging percentage of .538."
Bobby Murcer,New York Yankees (1979–83),"On June 26, 1979, Murcer returned to the Yankees in a trade for Paul Semall and cash. After wearing uniform #1 from 1969 through 1974, Bobby donned jersey #2, when manager Billy Martin re-adopted the #1.
On August 2, 1979, Yankees catcher/captain Thurman Munson died in a plane crash. Murcer gave one of the eulogies at his funeral on August 6 in Canton, Ohio, in which he quoted the poet and philosopher Angelo Patri: ""The life of a soul on earth lasts longer than his departure. He lives on in your life and the life of all others who knew him."" Afterward, the team flew home to play the first-place Baltimore Orioles in a game which was broadcast nationally on ABC-TV. Yankee manager Billy Martin wanted to give Murcer the day off, but Murcer insisted on playing. He practically won the game single-handedly, bringing the Yankees back from a 4–0 deficit with a 3-run homer in the 7th, then hitting a walk-off 2-run single down the left-field line in the bottom of the 9th, causing Howard Cosell to exclaim what a heroic performance Murcer had put on. Murcer never used the bat from the game again and gave it to Munson's widow, Diana.
On July 2, 2004, the Seattle Times reported that Diana Munson put the bat, along with other items of Munson's, up for auction. Mrs. Munson said she wants to use the proceeds to open trust funds for her grandchildren. ""You reach an age when you think about the future"", she said.In August 2007, the YES Network replayed the game for a new generation of Yankee fans due to a switch of the copyright of the game from ABC to Major League Baseball. About the game, Murcer says that he was playing on ""shock adrenaline"" and that the game has become ""part of my legacy"".After the murder of NFL player Sean Taylor, The Washington Post asked Murcer about how an organization deals with such a tragedy, ""You can't forget the moment, because it's so emotional"", said Murcer, ""It's a very moving experience ... that next game, we got to remember him as an individual and as a team. But it's not only us that's hurting. It's the fans. It's as much for them as it is for you as an individual. It reminds you that the fans who follow the team, it's as big a part of their lives as it is for you.""Murcer was fifth in the league in 1980 with nine sacrifice flies. Murcer cracked a two-out, two-run homer in the ninth inning on June 14, 1980, rallying the Yankees to a win over the Oakland A's. On July 4, 1980, Murcer hit a grand slam in an 11–5 rout of the Cleveland Indians. He was also credited with 13 game-winning RBIs in his first full season back from the National League. For the remaining years with the Yankees, he was reduced to a part time player ending his ability to be a star player.
In the winter between the 1980 and 1981 season, Murcer traveled to Japan with an American League ""All-Star"" team to play a series of exhibition games against a National League team to reportedly promote American baseball.

On opening day in 1981 vs Texas, Murcer hit a pinch-hit grand slam at Yankee Stadium. Alfonso Soriano and Russ Derry are the only other two Yankees to achieve that feat. On September 26, 1981, he hit a three-run pinch-hit homer in the 9th inning in a 6–4 Yankee win over Baltimore. In 1981, he led the pinch hitters of the American League with three home runs and 12 RBIs. He also led the club in slugging percentage (.470). He finished the season by batting as designated hitter in the 1981 World Series.
Prior to the 1982 season, Murcer signed a three-year, $1.12 million contract with the Yankees. On July 28, 1982, Murcer hit a 3-run pinch-hit home run to defeat the Detroit Tigers.
On June 1, 1983, Murcer hit his 100th home run at Yankee Stadium, which was the 252nd and final home run of his career. His retirement on June 20, 1983, was hastened by the Yankees wanting to bring up rookie first baseman/outfielder Don Mattingly. Murcer, fittingly, was the last active player to have been a playing teammate of Mickey Mantle. His final game came on June 11, 1983. On August 7, 1983, the Yankees honored his years in pinstripes with ""Bobby Murcer Day"". Since baseball's contracts are guaranteed Murcer collected the remainder of his contract (estimated at $360,000 a year) through 1984.
A 1985 comeback attempt ended after four minor league games where Murcer went 1 for 12 before suffering a shoulder injury.Once while playing with the Yankees, he and two other teammates got caught in a bizarre 2–5–3–1 triple play. During his second tenure with the Yankees, he also served as the team's player union representative. He was, at various points in his 
career, the highest-paid Yankee, Giant, and Cub in history (all since broken) and in his 17-years in the Major Leagues Murcer earned just shy of $3 million, including the signing bonus he received in the 1960s, meaning his career average was around $173,000.He was also the only Yankee to be teammates with Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford, Thurman Munson, Elston Howard, Roger Maris, Reggie Jackson, Don Mattingly, and Ron Guidry."
Bobby Murcer,Player profile,"A left-handed hitter, Murcer had a career .277 batting average, finishing with 252 home runs and 1,043 RBIs. He hit .301 with runners on third base. He was only the third New York Yankee (after Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle) to earn $100,000 per season, and at 26 years of age was the youngest American League player to earn a six-figure salary. Murcer made the All-Star teams from 1971 through 1974 in the American League, and in 1975 in the National League. He also won a Gold Glove in 1972.
He was noted for excelling at the delayed steal in which, as the catcher catches the ball or is about to throw the ball back to the pitcher, the runner on first base breaks for second base. The thought is that the second baseman and shortstop will be back on their heels and slow to cover the bag. After working with Mickey Mantle, he was also known as an excellent drag bunter.At his retirement, Murcer's 252 career home runs were tied for 72nd place on the all-time home run list, and his 175 home runs as a Yankee put him 11th on the club's career list. At his death, Murcer was tied for 183rd on the all-time list.
Against Hall of Fame pitchers, Murcer hit .289 with 20 homers and 72 RBIs in 447 at bats. If Tommy John is inducted, Murcer's numbers total 553 at-bats with 20 home runs, 76 RBIs and a .297 average—stellar numbers versus an elite group of pitchers.
In the 1970s, Murcer drove in 840 runs, the 9th most in the major leagues during that span. Murcer's 119 outfield assists led all major league outfielders for that decade, ahead of Bobby Bonds (106), Rusty Staub (97), Amos Otis (93), Reggie Smith (86), José Cardenal (85), Del Unser (82), and Reggie Jackson (81). His 198 homers tied for 17th in the major leagues for the 1970s, and his .282 batting average was 20th among all players who had 5,000 or more plate appearances. During the 1970s, he led his club in home runs six times (1970, 71, 72, 73, 76, 77).
In MLB history only 24 players hit above .275 while also hitting 250 or more home runs, driving in more than 1,000 runs, and stealing more than 125 bases and totaling 45 or more triples. Among that elite group only Murcer, George Brett, and Rogers Hornsby struck out fewer than 1,000 times."

Bobby Murcer,Post-playing career,"Murcer was also involved in the team as management and part-time coach as well. He was an assistant Yankee general manager in 1985, and individually worked with Rickey Henderson's rehab efforts when Henderson was brought to the Yankees. In 1987, George Steinbrenner hired Murcer to coach left-handed hitters. In 1989, he became partial owner of the Class AAA baseball team in Oklahoma, the Oklahoma City 89ers. He was also a regular at the annual Yankees Old Timer's Game, playing his last game in 2007."
Bobby Murcer,Broadcasting,"After his retirement, Murcer turned to a career in broadcasting. He was a sportscaster for the Yankees—on broadcast TV, radio, and the YES Network—for most of the two decades. He and colleague Frank Messer were behind the WPIX microphones as the infamous pine tar incident unfolded at Yankee Stadium on July 24, 1983. Murcer also worked games for NBC, teaming with Ted Robinson.
Murcer continued to call games on WPIX until 1998, when the station lost the rights to broadcast the Yankees (they would pick up the broadcast rights to the Mets instead). He then moved to WNYW, where he and Tim McCarver (later Suzyn Waldman) shared play-by-play roles. He would remain there until 2001 (calling, among other games, David Cone's 1999 perfect game), and then moved to the YES Network to call the games there and on its broadcast partners (originally WCBS, now WWOR-TV), with a reduced workload. Murcer won three Emmy Awards for live sports coverage as the voice of the Yankees.In November 2007, Murcer was nominated for the Ford C. Frick Award, presented annually to a broadcaster for ""major contributions to baseball"" by the Baseball Hall of Fame. The 2008 award, as announced three months later, went to longtime Seattle broadcaster Dave Niehaus."
Bobby Murcer,Anti-tobacco activism,"Murcer was a tobacco user for most of his life. In the late 1990s, he conceded what he thought was the error of his ways. After having a family member that suffered from cancer, Murcer became an anti-tobacco activist, according to the AP. The Senate of the State of Oklahoma passed Senate Bill 619 that purported to ""beef up local regulation of tobacco sales to minors"". The bill was passed by the lower chamber and signed into law."
Bobby Murcer,Opinions on the Mitchell Report,"Murcer defended Yankee pitchers Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte, who were accused of using performance-enhancing drugs in the Mitchell Report, which was released in December 2007. Murcer was quoted in the Daily Oklahoman as saying, ""Roger or Andy, either one, have never been accused of taking illegal drugs"", Murcer said. ""I mean, they never tested positive for any of that."" He further added, ""I can't convict somebody on allegations"" and ""with all the testing that's going on today, and Andy and Roger never testing positive for anything, I can't assume somebody's guilty based on the testimony of a disgruntled trainer."""
Bobby Murcer,Autobiography,"In May 2008, Murcer's autobiography, Yankee for Life: My 40-Year Journey in Pinstripes, was published by HarperCollins. The book received widespread critical acclaim. The book was a retrospective on Murcer's baseball career and also his personal struggles with illness. It covers the pressure of being the ""next Mickey Mantle"", his disappointment at being traded away from the Yankees, his ""feud"" with Gaylord Perry, and lists his ""1965–2007 Yankee All-Star team""."
Bobby Murcer,In the media,"Aside from his broadcasting, Murcer was active in the media. He had guest appearances on Beat the Clock, Hee Haw, What's My Line? (as a mystery guest), ""Let's Make a Deal, appeared in national television ads in the late 1970s along with Carlton Fisk endorsing the dipping tobacco Skoal, and was a guest VJ on MTV with Billy Martin in July 1986. In 1988 Murcer entered and finished the New York City Marathon.
He recorded two country songs, ""Skoal Dippin' Man"" and ""Bad Whiskey"" in 1982, both released by Columbia Records, and appeared in two films as himself, including The Scout. He was also part of a four-player biography in 1973, ""At Bat!: Aaron-Murcer-Bench-Jackson"", by Bill Gutman, published by Tempo Books."
Bobby Murcer,Personal life,"Murcer married his high school sweetheart, Diana Kay Rhodes (known as ""Kay""), in 1966. They were married for 42 years until his death, and had two children, Tori and Todd.In July 2006, Aduddell Industries of Oklahoma City named Murcer as corporate spokesperson.During his career, he invested in jewelry stores, an oil drilling company, a hair cutting establishment franchise called Yankee Cuts, and racehorses.Murcer was involved with many charities, including serving as the chairman of the board of the Baseball Assistance Team (B.A.T.), which grants money to former players and other baseball figures who are in need, and holding an annual golf tournament which has raised more than $1 million for the American Cancer Society since 1990. In 1995, he joined with fellow Oklahoman Mickey Mantle to raise money for the victims of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing. B.A.T. presents an annual ""Bobby Murcer Award"" to the two major league teams (one AL and one NL) whose players commit the most resources to the organization.Murcer also appeared in celebrity rodeos for various charitable organizations showing his skills in riding horses and roping."
Bobby Murcer,Illness and death,"According to the New York Daily News, Murcer had been suffering from headaches and a lack of energy. He was diagnosed with a brain tumor (glioblastoma multiforme) on Christmas Eve, 2006, and underwent surgery four days later at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. On January 10, 2007, it was announced that the tumor was malignant.
Murcer made his first post-operative appearance on fellow Yankee broadcaster Michael Kay's radio show on WEPN on January 23, 2007.  He was interviewed by Kay and took phone calls from listeners. Murcer concluded the interview by saying, ""I want to thank you very much for giving me the forum to do this because I wanted you to know that even though this looks bad, I'm doing great. I really am. I'm in a great place. God has given me peace and the overwhelming love has been insurmountable for me to even deal with. I can feel the fans. I can feel their thoughts and their prayers and I wanted to tell them how much I love them.""Murcer returned to Yankee Stadium for Opening Day of the 2007 season. He called an inning with the YES Network crew, and once his presence was pointed out on the video scoreboard, he received a standing ovation from the crowd, with the Yankees coming out of the dugout to applaud him. He returned to work as an announcer in the booth on May 1, 2007.The Tug McGraw Foundation, which supports research to improve quality of life for brain tumor patients and their families, honored Murcer as their ""Good Guy of 2007"". The award was given at the ""Denim & Diamonds: An Evening with Tim McGraw and Friends"" on November 2, 2007, St. Louis.In January 2008, he was honored by the New York Chapter of the BBWA as the winner of the ""You Gotta Have Heart"" award for his battle against cancer.In late February 2008, an MRI scan led Murcer's doctors to perform a biopsy, and, optimistically, the biopsy revealed scar tissue, rather than a recurrence of brain cancer. Murcer stated he planned to rest until spring training where he planned to call Yankee games and work in the YES Network studio. He released his autobiography Yankee For Life, co-authored with Glen Waggoner, on May 20; he appeared in the broadcast booth for the last time two weeks earlier to promote it. The book dealt with his forty years in Major League Baseball and his battle with brain cancer. His last public appearance was May 27, in New York while promoting his book, signing autographs for 2,000 fans despite being frail and physically weak. In addition, he had planned to work 60 Yankee home games for the 2008 season.On June 30, Murcer's family released a statement that he had suffered a relapse:

Bobby Murcer continues to recover from the effects of cancer and shingles, which caused him to cut short his broadcasting work and his book tour earlier this month. He has been under medical care in Oklahoma City.
The cancer treatment over the last 18 months has been intensive and has, as a side effect, somewhat compromised his immune system and made the fight all the more challenging. While he has shown some measured improvement in recent days, this is clearly a major battle, as all who have been through it understand.

Bobby remains hopeful that he will be able to resume his broadcasting work down the road, but for now, is appreciative of the thoughts and prayers of his fans, and wants them to know that he is aware that he is in their hearts, as they are in his.
Two weeks later, on July 12, Nancy Newman of the Yankees' YES Network reported that Murcer had died due to complications related to brain cancer. He was reportedly surrounded by family in his deathbed in his home in Oklahoma City. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner issued a statement following his death: ""Bobby Murcer was a born Yankee, a great guy, very well-liked and a true friend of mine. I extend my deepest sympathies to his wife Kay, their children and grandchildren. I will really miss the guy."" Baseball commissioner Bud Selig eulogized, ""All of Major League Baseball is saddened today by the passing of Bobby Murcer, particularly on the eve of this historic All-Star game at Yankee Stadium, a place he called home for so many years. Bobby was a gentleman, a great ambassador for baseball, and a true leader both on and off the field. He was a man of great heart and compassion.""
The memorial service for Murcer was held in Oklahoma City on August 6, 2008, at the Memorial Road Church of Christ. Among the 2,000 attending the service were Reggie Jackson, Derek Jeter, Andy Pettitte and Joe Girardi. Also in attendance was Diana Munson, the widow of Yankee captain Thurman Munson. The August 6 date was 29 years to the day since Murcer gave the eulogy at Thurman Munson's funeral and is also the 25th anniversary of Bobby Murcer Day at Yankee Stadium. The uniform worn by Murcer at his final Yankee Stadium Old Timer's Day appearance in 2007 was presented to his spouse Kay. His tomb is located at the Rose Hill Mausoleum in Oklahoma City, on the left side of the building."

Dnestr radar,TsSO-P,"The Dnestr radar came from work on ballistic missile defence undertaken in the late 1950s and early 1960s. System A, the prototype for the A-35 anti-ballistic missile system, was set up in the Sary Shagan testing grounds, in the Kazakh SSR.: 123  Work on the system was led by design bureau KB-1 which proposed using VHF radar RTN (Russian: РТН) and the Dunay-2 UHF radar. Other alternatives were sought from Soviet industry and RTI proposed using VHF radar TsSO-P (Russian: ЦСО-П) and UHF radar  TsSS-30 (Russian: ЦСС-30).TsSO-P (standing for Russian: центральная станция обнаружения – полигонная meaning central detection station – test site) was selected for further development, together with the Dunay-2. TsSO-P had a long horn antenna 250 metres (820 ft) long and 15 metres (49 ft) high.  It had an array with an open ribbed structure and used 200 microseconds pulses. Hardware methods were designed for signal processing as the intended M-4 computer could not run. It was built at area 8 in Sary Shagan and was located at 46°00′04.65″N 73°38′52.11″E. It first detected an object on 17 September 1961.TsSO-P took part in the 1961 and 1962 Soviet Project K nuclear tests above the Sary Shagan range to examine the effects of high altitude nuclear explosions on missile defence hardware."
Dnestr radar,Dnestr,"TsSO-P was effective at satellite tracking and was chosen as the radar of the Istrebitel Sputnikov (IS) anti-satellite programme. This programme involved the construction of two sites separated in latitude to form a radar field 5,000 kilometres (3,100 mi) long and 3,000 kilometres (1,900 mi) high. The two sites chosen were at the village of Mishelevka near Irkutsk in Siberia, which was called OS-1, and at Cape Gulshad on Lake Balkhash near Sary Shagan, which was called OS-2. Each site received four Dnestr radar systems in a fan arrangement.: 421 : 433 A Dnestr radar was composed of two TsSO-P radar wings joined together by a two-story building containing a joint computer system and command post. Each radar wing covered a 30-degree sector with a 0.5 degree scanning beam. The elevation scanning pattern was a 'spade' with a width of 20 degrees. The radar systems were arranged to create a fan shaped barrier. Of the four radars, called cells (Russian: РЛЯ, tr. RLYa roughly radio location cell), two faced to the west and two faced to the east. All scanned between +10 degrees and +90 degrees in elevation.Construction at the two sites started between 1962 and 1963 with improvements in the TsSO-P test model being fed back into the deployed units. They gained an M-4 2-M computer with semiconductors, although the rest of the radar used Vacuum tubes. The radar systems were completed in late 1966 with the fourth Dnestr at Balkhash being used for testing. In 1968 the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik target satellite, DS-P1-Yu, was used to test the ability of the system.The Dnestr radars were accepted for service by the Soviet Air Defence Forces in April 1967 and became part of the space surveillance network SKKP.: 434"
Dnestr radar,Dnestr-M,"Parallel with the implementation of the Dnestr space surveillance units, a modified version of the original Dnestr units, Dnestr-M radar, was being developed to act as an early warning radar to identify attacks by ballistic missiles. The first two were built at Murmansk in northern Russia (Olenegorsk – RO-1) and near Riga in the then Latvian SSR (Skrunda – RO-2). They constituted the beginning of the Soviet SPRN network, the equivalent of the NATO BMEWS.: 421 The first Dnestr-M at Olenegorsk was completed by 1968. In 1970, the radars at Olenegorsk and Skrunda, and an associated command centre at Solnechnogorsk, were accepted for service. According to Podvig (2002), it seems they were positioned to identify missile launches from NATO submarines in the Norwegian and North Seas.The Dnestr-M included many improvements over the previous versions such as an increase in the pulse length from 200μs to 800μs which increased the range of objects identified, more semiconductors, and many other scanning and processing changes.A version of this radar was built at the Sary Shagan test site and was called TsSO-PM (Russian: ЦСО-ПМ). After this had completed tests in 1965 it was decided to upgrade nodes 1 and 2 of the two OS sites to Dnestr-M, keeping nodes 3 and 4 as Dnestr. These radars remained as space surveillance radars which scanned between +10 and +90 degrees, comparative to scanning between +10 and +30 degrees for the missile warning radars. A space surveillance network of four Dnestrs and four Dnestr-Ms, and two command posts was formally commissioned in 1971."
Dnestr radar,Dnepr,"Work to improve the radar continued. An improved array was designed which covered 60 degrees rather than 30. The first Dnepr radar was built at Balkhash as a new radar, cell 5. It entered service on 12 May 1974. The second was a new early warning station at Sevastopol. New Dneprs were also built at Mishelevka and another at Skrunda, and then one at Mukachevo. The remaining radars were all converted to Dnepr with the exception of cells 3 and 4 at Balkhash and Mishelevka which remained space surveillance radars.: 422 All current operational radars are described as Dnepr, and have been updated incrementally."
Dnestr radar,Technical details,"Each Dnepr array is a double sectoral horn antenna 250m long by 12 m wide. It has two rows of slot radiators within two waveguides. At each end of the two arrays, there is a set of transmitting and receiving equipment. It emits a signal covering a sector 30 degrees in azimuth and 30 degrees in elevation, with the scanning controlled by frequency. Four sets mean the radar covers 120 degrees in azimuth and 30 degrees in elevation (5 to 35 degrees).The Dnepr involved the horn antenna being reduced from 20 to 14 metres in height and the addition of a polarising filter"
Dnestr radar,Current status,"These radars have been installed at six different radar stations and as of 2012 are operational at three – Balkhash, Mishelevka and Olenegorsk. The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty required that early warning radars were located on the periphery of national territory and faced outwards. This caused problems when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 as many of the radar stations were now in newly independent states. The first station to close was Skrunda, in newly independent Latvia. A 1994 agreement between Russia and Latvia agreed that the two Dnepr radars there would stop working in 1998, and would be fully demolished by 2000.: 129 : 65 : 426 Russia signed an agreement with Ukraine in 1992 allowing it to continue using the Dnepr radars at Sevastopol and Mukachevo. The stations were run by Ukrainian personnel and data was sent to the headquarters of the Russian early warning system in Solnechnogorsk. In 2008 Russia announced that it was pulling out of the agreement with Ukraine and that the last data given to Russia from the stations would be in 2009.: 76  The Ukrainian government announced that the stations were to be used part-time for space surveillance.The remaining stations in Russia and abroad are being replaced by the Voronezh radar. The Dneprs in Mishelevka, Irkutsk will close once the second array of the new Voronezh radar is operational. The Dnepr at Olenegorsk, Murmansk will be replaced by a Voronezh as well. It is planned to start construction there in 2017."

Northwestern Mari people,History,"The origin of the Northwestern Maris belongs to the larger history of the Mari people. Most scientists, based on linguistic and archaeological data, associated them with being descendants of the north-western part of the Iron Age Gorodets culture. It was localized between the middle Volga's right tributaries Oka and Sura. In the 6th century AD Gorodets population moved to the north bank of Volga up to Vetluga and Bolshaya Kokshaga rivers. There they was greatly influenced by the Ananyino culture. The differences between Northwestern and other groups of Mari appeared in the 9th-10th centuries. In the 10th-13th centuries some related upper Volga Dyakovo tribes joined to Northwestern Maris and were assimilated by them. During the unification of Russian principalities around Moscow the part of Northwestern Mari became a part of Moscovian State."

William Glasgow (general),Early life,"Thomas William Glasgow was born on 6 June 1876 at Tiaro, near Maryborough, Queensland. He was the fourth child of Mary (née Anderson) and Samuel Glasgow. His father was a farmer of Ulster Scots origin. Glasgow undertook his schooling at One Mile State School in Gympie, Queensland, and then later at Maryborough Grammar School. Upon completion of his schooling, Glasgow worked as a junior clerk for a mining company in Gympie, before moving to the Queensland National Bank, in the same town, also in a clerical role."
William Glasgow (general),Boer War and early military career,"Glasgow joined the Wide Bay Regiment of the Queensland Mounted Infantry in 1893, and he was sent to London in 1897 as part of a small contingent of 20 personnel from Queensland to attend the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. In 1899, he volunteered for service in South Africa and was commissioned as a lieutenant, assigned to the 1st Queensland Mounted Infantry Contingent. While in South Africa, he took part in the relief of Kimberley, the fighting on the Modder, and the occupation of Bloemfontein. For his services, he was mentioned in despatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in 1901.After returning to Australia, Glasgow went into business with his younger brother Alexander, and together they operated their father's grocery store in Gympie. Glasgow married Annie Isabel Stumm, on 21 April 1904; her father, Jacob, was the Federal member for Lilley. Later, Glasgow became a pastoralist after purchasing a cattle station in central Queensland.Glasgow remained in the militia, and in 1903, he raised a unit at Gympie, which was designated as the 13th Light Horse Regiment. On 6 May 1912, Glasgow was promoted to captain. Another promotion came on 6 May 1912 when he received his majority. When war broke out in 1914, he  volunteered to join the Australian Imperial Force. Keeping his rank, he was appointed as second-in-command of the 2nd Light Horse Regiment, on 19 August. On 24 September 1914, Glasgow embarked for the Middle East, arriving in Egypt where the light horsemen undertook training until they were transferred Anzac Cove in a dismounted role, to reinforce the infantry that had landed there in April 1915."
William Glasgow (general),First World War,"After the arrival of the light horsemen at Anzac in mid-May 1915, the commander of the 1st Light Horse Brigade, Colonel Harry Chauvel, assumed control of Monash Valley. Following a reorganisation of the defences at Pope's Hill, Glasgow  became second-in-command to the commander of the 3rd Light Horse Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Frank Rowell. While troops from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Regiments rotated through the position on weekly basis, Rowell and his staff remained to oversee the position. However, Rowell became ill and died in early August, after which Glasgow assumed command of the position. On 7 August 1915, Glasgow led an attack on Dead Man's Ridge; the ridge had sweeping views of The Nek. The assault secured part of the Turkish trenchline, but after the failed attack on the Nek, Glasgow, realising that the ridge would now be subjected to a strong counter-attack, ordered a retreat. Bringing up the rear, Glasgow, carried one of the wounded back as the Australians withdrew. Of the 200 men who had taken part in the attack, 60 had been killed, and another 94 wounded, including every officer except Glasgow. In the aftermath, Glasgow was promoted to lieutenant colonel and given command of the 2nd Light Horse Regiment.

In December 1915, the Allied forces withdrew from Gallipoli. In the aftermath, the Australian government decided to expand the AIF in Egypt prior to its commitment to the Western Front. As part of this process, the 13th Brigade was raised from a cadre of experienced personnel from the 3rd Brigade and reinforcements from Australia.  Glasgow was given command of the new brigade in March 1916. He commanded the brigade for the next two years, including their first major action in September 1916, at Mouquet Farm. Later, the brigade fought around Messines in June 1917, Polygon Wood in September and Dernancourt in early April 1918, where the brigade fought a defensive action that helped halt the German Spring Offensive. After the Germans captured Villers-Bretonneux in mid-April 1918, Glasgow's brigade was assigned to launch a counterattack to retake the village, on the right of the attacking force. Glasgow did not agree with the 8:00 pm start time of the attack: he wanted to attack under moonlight at 10:30pm, but this was adjusted to 10:00pm. Ross Mallett recounts that ""at the height of the battle, with the 13th Brigade surrounded on three sides, the Germans had sent Glasgow a message demanding that he surrender. 'Tell them to go to Hell' was his response"".At the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux in April 1918, Glasgow's 13th Brigade, and Harold Elliott's 15th Brigade, recaptured the town of Villers-Bretonneux on 25 April 1918 after the Germans had overrun the British 8th Division under General William Heneker. This feat was described by Lieutenant-General Sir John Monash as the turning-point of the war, although, according to historian Peter Dennis this characterisation was an exaggeration.As the German offensive was fought to a halt, Glasgow was appointed to take over command of the 1st Division on 30 June 1918. At the time, the division was assigned to the front in Flanders, where it was fighting beside British formations; but later, the 1st Division was moved to the Somme. During the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, Glasgow's division fought actions at Amiens (8 August 1918), Lihons (9–11 August 1918), Chuignes (23 August 1918) and along the Hindenburg Line (18 September 1918). The Australians were withdrawn from the line in October, and did not see action again before the war came to an end in November 1918.After the war, Glasgow returned to part-time soldiering, and in 1921 he was placed in command of the 4th Division. He was also heavily involved with commemoration services, and according to Mallett, he led ""the Anzac Day parade in Brisbane for twenty years""."
William Glasgow (general),Politics,"After his return to Australia, Glasgow was demobilised in August 1919, and was elected to the Senate at the 1919 federal election, standing for the Nationalist Party in Queensland. In June 1926, Prime Minister Stanley Bruce promoted him to cabinet as Minister for Home and Territories. He was promoted to Minister for Defence in April 1927, which office he held until the government's defeat at the 1929 election when James Scullin's Labor government assumed power. He was subsequently elected Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. According to Mallett, ""Glasgow saw his role as frustrating Labor's inflationary policies"". Later, during the 1931 election, a swing toward the Labor Party in Queensland – contrary to the result at the national level – resulted in Glasgow losing his seat. He subsequently returned to his career as a pastoralist. He also undertook the directorship of several companies."
William Glasgow (general),High Commissioner to Canada,"Glasgow became the first Australian High Commissioner to Canada when he was appointed to the role in December 1939.  At the time, Australia had few overseas diplomatic missions, with Canada being only the fifth to receive an Australian diplomatic representative. In the role, Glasgow was involved in negotiating and overseeing aspects of the Empire Air Training Scheme in Canada, and promoted the Australian war effort. According to Mallett, in the role,  Glasgow ""built good relations with the Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King and his ministers, but was not successful in getting Canadian support for Australian strategy in the Pacific"". Nevertheless, he successfully worked to establish a ""mutual aid"" agreement that saw Australia receive two merchant ships from Canada. Glasgow also attended several inter-Allied conferences in Quebec in August 1943 and September 1944, where he ""represented Australian interests""."
William Glasgow (general),Final years,"In 1945, after being succeeded as High Commissioner by Alfred Stirling, Glasgow returned to Australia. The war over, he returned to private life, continuing his work as a businessman and pastoralist. He died on 4 July 1955, in Brisbane. His wife, Annie, and their two daughters survived him. After a state funeral at  St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Glasgow was cremated."
William Glasgow (general),Honours,"For his services during the war, Glasgow received several honours. In June 1916, he became a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG). This was followed in December 1917 by appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). In the 1919 New Year Honours, he  was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). He was Mentioned in Despatches a further nine times (in addition to the one from the Boer War) and was also appointed an Officer of the Légion d'Honneur by the French. He also received the French Croix de Guerre and the Belgian Croix de Guerre.A statue of Glasgow, cast in bronze, was erected in Brisbane in 1966, near Roma and Turbot Streets. During 2008, the statue was moved to Post Office Square (opposite ANZAC Square), also in Brisbane."
